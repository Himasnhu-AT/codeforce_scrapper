There are two servers, each with its separate counts for the upvotes and the downvotes.</p><p>$$$n$$$ reviewers enter the site one by one. Each reviewer is one of the following types: </p><ul> <li> type $$$1$$$: a reviewer has watched the movie, and they like it\u00a0\u2014 they press the upvote button; </li><li> type $$$2$$$: a reviewer has watched the movie, and they dislike it\u00a0\u2014 they press the downvote button; </li><li> type $$$3$$$: a reviewer hasn't watched the movie\u00a0\u2014 they look at the current number of upvotes and downvotes of the movie on the server they are in and decide what button to press. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, then a reviewer downvotes the movie. Otherwise, they upvote the movie. </li></ul><p>Each reviewer votes on the movie exactly once.</p><p>Since you have two servers, you can actually manipulate the votes so that your movie gets as many upvotes as possible.
