However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:</p><p>You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. You are also given an integer $$$k$$$. Lord Omkar wants you to do $$$k$$$ operations with this array.</p><p>Define one operation as the following: </p><ol> <li> Set $$$d$$$ to be the maximum value of your array. </li><li> For every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, replace $$$a_{i}$$$ with $$$d-a_{i}$$$. </li></ol><p>The goal is to predict the contents in the array after $$$k$$$ operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$).
