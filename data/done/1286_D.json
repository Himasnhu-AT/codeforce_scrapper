When the experiment starts at time 0, $$$i$$$-th proton flies from the $$$i$$$-th pipe with speed $$$v_i$$$. It flies to the right with probability $$$p_i$$$ and flies to the left with probability $$$(1 - p_i)$$$. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">duration of the experiment</span> is determined as the time of the first collision of any two protons.
