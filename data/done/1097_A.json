His favorite game is called \"Mau-Mau\".</p><p>To play Mau-Mau, you need a pack of $$$52$$$ cards. Each card has a suit (Diamonds \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>, Clubs \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>, Spades \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">S</span>, or Hearts \u2014 <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">H</span>), and a rank (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">3</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">4</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">5</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">6</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">7</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">8</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">9</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">T</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">J</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Q</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">K</span>, or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>).</p><p>At the start of the game, there is one card on the table and you have five cards in your hand. You can play a card from your hand if and only if it has the same rank or the same suit as the card on the table.</p><p>In order to check if you'd be a good playing partner, Gennady has prepared a task for you. Given the card on the table and five cards in your hand, check if you can play at least one card.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains one string which describes the card on the table. The second line contains five strings which describe the cards in your hand.</p><p>Each string is two characters long.
