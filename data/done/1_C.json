    "statement": "<p>Nowadays all circuses in Berland have a round arena with diameter 13 meters, but in the past things were different.</p><p>In Ancient Berland arenas in circuses were shaped as a regular (equiangular) polygon, the size and the number of angles could vary from one circus to another. In each corner of the arena there was a special pillar, and the rope strung between the pillars marked the arena edges.</p><p>Recently the scientists from Berland have discovered the remains of the ancient circus arena. They found only three pillars, the others were destroyed by the time.</p><p>You are given the coordinates of these three pillars. Find out what is the smallest area that the arena could have.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The input file consists of three lines, each of them contains a pair of numbers \u2013\u2013 coordinates of the pillar. Any coordinate doesn't exceed 1000 by absolute value, and is given with at most six digits after decimal point.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output the smallest possible area of the ancient arena. This number should be accurate to at least 6 digits after the decimal point. It's guaranteed that the number of angles in the optimal polygon is not larger than 100.</p>",
