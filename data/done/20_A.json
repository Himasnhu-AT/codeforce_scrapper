It is possible to use any number of characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'/'</span> as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'/'</span>. For example, strings <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">//usr///local//nginx/sbin//</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">/usr/local/nginx///sbin</span> are equivalent. The character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'/'</span> (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'/'</span>.</p><p>A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'/'</span>.</p><p>Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.</p>",
