    "statement": "<p>Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up $$$q$$$ questions about this song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the $$$l$$$-th letter to the $$$r$$$-th letter. Vasya considers a substring made up from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment $$$k$$$ times, where $$$k$$$ is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abbcb</span>\", then Vasya repeats letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' once, each of the letters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>' twice, letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\" three times, so that the resulting string is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abbbbcccbb</span>\", its length is $$$10$$$. Vasya is interested about the length of the resulting string.</p><p>Help Petya find the length of each string obtained by Vasya.</p>",

In the first question Vasya considers the substring \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aba</span>\", that transforms to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abba</span>\", so the answer is equal to $$$4$$$. In the second question Vasya considers \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">baca</span>\", that transforms to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bbaccca</span>\", so the answer is $$$7$$$.
