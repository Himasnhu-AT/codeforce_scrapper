A bracket sequence is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">regular</span> if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" into this sequence. For example, \"\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(())</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()()</span>\" are regular bracket sequences; \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">))</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)((</span>\" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(a)</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(1)+(1)</span>\" are not bracket sequences at all.</p><p>You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $$$2$$$. So, overall you have $$$cnt_1$$$ strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">((</span>\", $$$cnt_2$$$ strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()</span>\", $$$cnt_3$$$ strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)(</span>\" and $$$cnt_4$$$ strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">))</span>\". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $$$2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$$$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either</span>.</p>",
