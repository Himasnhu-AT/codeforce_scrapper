These rating changes are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">perfectly balanced</span>\u00a0\u2014 their sum is equal to $$$0$$$.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">semi-rated</span>. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.</p><p>There are two conditions though: </p><ul> <li> For each participant $$$i$$$, their modified rating change $$$b_i$$$ must be integer, and as close to $$$\\frac{a_i}{2}$$$ as possible. It means that either $$$b_i = \\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$ or $$$b_i = \\lceil \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rceil$$$. In particular, if $$$a_i$$$ is even, $$$b_i = \\frac{a_i}{2}$$$. Here $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than $$$x$$$, and $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than $$$x$$$. </li><li> The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced\u00a0\u2014 their sum must be equal to $$$0$$$. </li></ul><p>Can you help with that?</p>",
