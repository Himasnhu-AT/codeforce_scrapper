Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.</span></p><p>Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer $$$x$$$ as <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nearly prime</span> if it can be represented as $$$p \\cdot q$$$, where $$$1 &lt; p &lt; q$$$ and $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are prime numbers. For example, integers $$$6$$$ and $$$10$$$ are nearly primes (since $$$2 \\cdot 3 = 6$$$ and $$$2 \\cdot 5 = 10$$$), but integers $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$16$$$, $$$17$$$ or $$$44$$$ are not.</p><p>Captain Flint guessed an integer $$$n$$$ and asked you: can you represent it as <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">the sum of $$$4$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different positive</span> integers</span> where <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least $$$3$$$</span> of them should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">nearly prime</span>.</p><p>Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew.
