Each vertex $$$v$$$ of this tree has a color assigned to it ($$$a_v = 1$$$ if the vertex $$$v$$$ is white and $$$0$$$ if the vertex $$$v$$$ is black).</p><p>You have to solve the following problem for each vertex $$$v$$$: what is the maximum difference between the number of white and the number of black vertices you can obtain if you choose some subtree of the given tree that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">contains</span> the vertex $$$v$$$? The subtree of the tree is the connected subgraph of the given tree. More formally, if you choose the subtree that contains $$$cnt_w$$$ white vertices and $$$cnt_b$$$ black vertices, you have to maximize $$$cnt_w - cnt_b$$$.</p>",
