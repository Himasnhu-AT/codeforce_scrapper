He thinks that a word is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">nice</span> if there exists a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">substring</span> (contiguous segment of letters) of it of length <span class=\"tex-span\">26</span> where each letter of English alphabet appears exactly once. In particular, if the string has length strictly less than <span class=\"tex-span\">26</span>, no such substring exists and thus it is not nice.</p><p>Now, ZS the Coder tells you a word, where some of its letters are missing as he forgot them. He wants to determine if it is possible to fill in the missing letters so that the resulting word is nice. If it is possible, he needs you to find an example of such a word as well. Can you help him?</p>",

In addition, the given string does not have a substring of length <span class=\"tex-span\">26</span> that contains all the letters of the alphabet, so the answer is <span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009-\u20091</span>.</p><p>In the third sample case, any string of length <span class=\"tex-span\">26</span> that contains all letters of the English alphabet fits as an answer.</p>",
