Initially they have a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$n$$$ is odd) consisting of digits. Vasya makes the first move, then players alternate turns. In one move the player <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">must</span> choose a character and erase it from the current string. For example, if the current string <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1121</span>, after the player's move it may be <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">112</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">111</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">121</span>. The game ends when the length of string $$$s$$$ becomes <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">11</span>. If the resulting string is a telephone number, Vasya wins, otherwise Petya wins.</p><p>You have to determine if Vasya has a winning strategy (that is, if Vasya can win the game no matter which characters Petya chooses during his moves).</p>",

The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">8</span> at all.</p>",
