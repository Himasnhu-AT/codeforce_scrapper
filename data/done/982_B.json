All integers $$$w_i$$$ are distinct.</p><p>Initially the bus is empty. On each of $$$2n$$$ stops one passenger enters the bus. There are two types of passengers: </p><ul> <li> an introvert always chooses a row where both seats are empty. Among these rows he chooses the one with the smallest seats width and takes one of the seats in it; </li><li> an extrovert always chooses a row where exactly one seat is occupied (by an introvert). Among these rows he chooses the one with the largest seats width and takes the vacant place in it. </li></ul><p>You are given the seats width in each row and the order the passengers enter the bus.
