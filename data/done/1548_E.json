The ceiling can be modeled as an $$$n \\times m$$$ grid.</p><p>For each $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive, painter Amin applies $$$a_i$$$ layers of paint to the entire $$$i$$$-th row. For each $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$, inclusive, painter Benj applies $$$b_j$$$ layers of paint to the entire $$$j$$$-th column. Therefore, the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ ends up with $$$a_i+b_j$$$ layers of paint.</p><p>Gregor considers the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ to be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">badly painted</span> if $$$a_i+b_j \\le x$$$. Define a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">badly painted region</span> to be a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximal</span> connected component of badly painted cells, i.\u00a0e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.</p><p>Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.</p>",
