For example, from the array $$$[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]$$$ Vasya can obtain array $$$[1, 1110, 10000]$$$, and from array $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ Vasya can obtain array $$$[6]$$$.</p><p>Two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ are considered equal if and only if they have the same length and for each valid $$$i$$$ $$$A_i = B_i$$$.</p><p>Vasya wants to perform some of these operations on array $$$A$$$, some on array $$$B$$$, in such a way that arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ become equal. Moreover, the lengths of the resulting arrays should be maximal possible.</p><p>Help Vasya to determine the maximum length of the arrays that he can achieve or output that it is impossible to make arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ equal.</p>",
