    "statement": "<p>Further research on zombie thought processes yielded interesting results. As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> brains and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>u</i>,\u2009<i>v</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i></span>) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.</p><p>In this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.</p>",

In the next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> lines, descriptions of brain connectors follow.
