However, she has to get an \u00abA\u00bb graduation certificate in order to apply to a prestigious one.</p><p>In school, where Noora is studying, teachers are putting down marks to the online class register, which are integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. The worst mark is <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, the best is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. Mark that is going to the certificate, is calculated as an average of all the marks, rounded to the closest integer. If several answers are possible, rounding up is produced. For example, <span class=\"tex-span\">7.3</span> is rounded to <span class=\"tex-span\">7</span>, but <span class=\"tex-span\">7.5</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">7.8784</span>\u00a0\u2014 to <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span>. </p><p>For instance, if Noora has marks <span class=\"tex-span\">[8,\u20099]</span>, then the mark to the certificate is <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span>, because the average is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">8.5</span> and rounded to <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span>, but if the marks are <span class=\"tex-span\">[8,\u20098,\u20099]</span>, Noora will have graduation certificate with <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span>.</p><p>To graduate with \u00abA\u00bb certificate, Noora <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">has to have mark</span> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>.</p><p>Noora got <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> marks in register this year. However, she is afraid that her marks are not enough to get final mark <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. Noora decided to ask for help in the internet, where hacker Leha immediately responded to her request. He is ready to hack class register for Noora and to add Noora any number of additional marks from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. At the same time, Leha want his hack be unseen to everyone, so he decided to add as less as possible additional marks. Please help Leha to calculate the minimal number of marks he has to add, so that final Noora's mark will become equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>.</p>",
