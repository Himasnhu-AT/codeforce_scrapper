This tree is built as follows.</p><p>Initially, the tree has only one vertex with the number $$$1$$$\u00a0\u2014 the root of the tree. Then, Vanya adds two children to it, assigning them consecutive numbers\u00a0\u2014 $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, respectively. After that, he will add children to the vertices in increasing order of their numbers, starting from $$$2$$$, assigning their children the minimum unused indices. As a result, Vanya will have an infinite tree with the root in the vertex $$$1$$$, where each vertex will have exactly two children, and the vertex numbers will be arranged sequentially by layers.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3fe851b2505ce276dabd4a63ad7472346f98f9a8.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Part of Vanya's tree.</span> </center><p>Vanya wondered what the sum of the vertex numbers on the path from the vertex with number $$$1$$$ to the vertex with number $$$n$$$ in such a tree is equal to.
