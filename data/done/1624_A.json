He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by $$$1$$$. As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array $$$a=[5,3,1,7,2]$$$.</p><p>What is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become $$$a_1=a_2=\\dots=a_n$$$)?</p>",
