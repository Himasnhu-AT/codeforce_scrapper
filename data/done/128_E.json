    "statement": "<p>Anna's got a birthday today. She invited many guests and cooked a huge (nearly infinite) birthday cake decorated by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> banana circles of different sizes. Maria's birthday is about to start in 7 minutes too, and while Anna is older, she decided to play the boss a little. She told Maria to cut the cake by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> straight-line cuts (the cutting lines can intersect) to divide banana circles into banana pieces. </p><p>Anna has many guests and she wants everyone to get at least one banana piece. That's why she told Maria to make the total number of banana pieces maximum. It's not a problem if some banana pieces end up on the same cake piece \u2014 the key is to make the maximum number of banana pieces. Determine what result Maria will achieve.</p>",
