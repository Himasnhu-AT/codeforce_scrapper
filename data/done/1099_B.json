    "statement": "<p>Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $$$n$$$ squares in the snow with a side length of $$$1$$$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $$$1$$$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.</p><p>In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(x, y+1)$$$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $$$(x', y)$$$ and $$$(x', y+1)$$$ for some $$$x'$$$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $$$x$$$, $$$x+1$$$ and the differing coordinate $$$y$$$.</p><p>For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/26ac7de0c2ac77f962c61a0d860b6f511c7ce1ff.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ae70996cc65f43dd87618da4e127cc62bc4ff759.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/67fc4924fcbc58105cd38e5f21558e464df4c714.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9ab71c1a21a5a72c86e0463454ebd9ac000ee819.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.</p>",
