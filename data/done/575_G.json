Little do you know, beer here is so good and strong that every time you drink it your speed goes 10 times slower than before you drank it.</p><p>Birko lives in city Beergrade, but wants to go to city Beerburg. You are given a road map of BubbleLand and you need to find the fastest way for him. When he starts his journey in Beergrade his speed is 1. When he comes to a new city he always tries a glass of local beer, which divides his speed by 10. </p><p>The question here is what the minimal time for him to reach Beerburg is. If there are several paths with the same minimal time, pick the one that has least roads on it. If there is still more than one path, pick any.</p><p>It is guaranteed that there will be at least one path from Beergrade to Beerburg.</p>",
