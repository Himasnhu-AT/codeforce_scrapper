But Lesha is quite impatient. The song's duration is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> seconds. Lesha downloads the first <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>S</i></span> seconds of the song and plays it. When the playback reaches the point that has not yet been downloaded, Lesha immediately plays the song from the start (the loaded part of the song stays in his phone, and the download is continued from the same place), and it happens until the song is downloaded completely and Lesha listens to it to the end. For <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i></span> seconds of real time the Internet allows you to download <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> seconds of the track.</p><p>Tell Lesha, for how many times he will start the song, including the very first start.</p>",

Note that song isn't restarted in this case.</p>",
