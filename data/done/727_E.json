The names were distinct, the length of each name was equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. The names didn't overlap.</p><p>Thus, there is a cyclic string of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u00b7<i>k</i></span> written on the CD.</p><p>Several years have passed and now Tolya can't remember which games he burned to his CD. He knows that there were <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>g</i></span> popular games that days.
