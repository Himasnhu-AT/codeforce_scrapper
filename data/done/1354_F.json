The initial power level of the $$$i$$$-th minion is $$$a_i$$$, and when it is summoned, all previously summoned minions' power levels are increased by $$$b_i$$$. The minions can be summoned in any order.</p><p>Unfortunately, Polycarp cannot have more than $$$k$$$ minions under his control. To get rid of unwanted minions after summoning them, he may destroy them. Each minion can be summoned (and destroyed) only once.</p><p>Polycarp's goal is to summon the strongest possible army. Formally, he wants to maximize the sum of power levels of all minions under his control (those which are summoned and not destroyed).</p><p>Help Polycarp to make up a plan of actions to summon the strongest possible army!</p>",

Then print $$$m$$$ integers $$$o_1$$$, $$$o_2$$$, ..., $$$o_m$$$, where $$$o_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th action as follows: if the $$$i$$$-th action is to summon the minion $$$x$$$, then $$$o_i = x$$$, and if the $$$i$$$-th action is to destroy the minion $$$x$$$, then $$$o_i = -x$$$. Each minion can be summoned at most once and cannot be destroyed before being summoned (and, obviously, cannot be destroyed more than once).

After this, Polycarp will have two minions with power levels of $$$10$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, Polycarp can control only one minion, so he should choose the strongest of them and summon it.</p><p>In the third test case, Polycarp is able to summon and control all five minions.</p>",
