For example, $$$f(11, 6) = (11|6) - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9$$$. It can be proved that for any nonnegative numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ value of $$$f(x, y)$$$ is also nonnegative. </p><p>She would like to research more about this function and has created multiple problems for herself. But she isn't able to solve all of them and needs your help. Here is one of these problems.</p><p>A value of an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$$$ is defined as $$$f(f(\\dots f(f(a_1, a_2), a_3), \\dots a_{n-1}), a_n)$$$ (see notes). You are given an array with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not necessarily distinct</span> elements. How should you reorder its elements so that the value of the array is maximal possible?</p>",
