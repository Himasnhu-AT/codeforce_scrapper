Everule will not be able to visit island $$$2$$$ but can still visit island $$$1$$$. Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is $$$1$$$.</p><p>In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge between islands $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, Everule can still visit island $$$2$$$ by traveling by $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 2$$$ as the bridges between $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, and between $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ are not destroyed.</p><p>In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since $$$k = \\frac{n \\cdot (n - 1)}{2}$$$. Everule will be only able to visit $$$1$$$ island (island $$$1$$$).</p>",
