MFO wants the $$$i$$$-th game to be played between the teams $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ in one of the $$$k$$$ stadiums. </p><p>Let $$$s_{ij}$$$ be the numbers of games the $$$i$$$-th team played in the $$$j$$$-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in one stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team $$$i$$$, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum among $$$s_{i1}, s_{i2}, \\ldots, s_{ik}$$$ should not exceed $$$2$$$.</p><p>Each team has $$$w_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the amount of money MFO will earn for <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">each</span> game of the $$$i$$$-th team. If the $$$i$$$-th team plays $$$l$$$ games, MFO will earn $$$w_i \\cdot l$$$.</p><p>MFO needs to find what games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money as possible, not violating the rule they set.</p><p>However, this problem is too complicated for MFO.
