At each second, Slime will choose a biscuit randomly uniformly among all $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n$$$ biscuits, and the owner of this biscuit will give it to a random uniform player among $$$n-1$$$ players except himself. The game stops when one person will have all the biscuits.</p><p>As the host of the party, Slime wants to know the expected value of the time that the game will last, to hold the next activity on time.</p><p>For convenience, as the answer can be represented as a rational number $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$ for coprime $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$, you need to find the value of $$$(p \\cdot q^{-1})\\mod 998\\,244\\,353$$$.
