Damage per hit is the amount of damage you deal with a single hit, while hits per second is the number of hits you can make in one second. Initially, both skill attributes are set at $$$0$$$. You have $$$k$$$ skill points to distribute as you want; in other words, you can choose the values of the two skills so that they are positive integers with sum at most $$$k$$$. </p><p>The tutorial of the game (the boring part you want to finish as soon as possible) consists of $$$n$$$ monsters to be killed one after the other. The $$$i$$$-th monster has $$$h_i$$$ health points, i.e., it dies after you have inflicted at least $$$h_i$$$ damage.</p><p>How can you assign the two skill attributes to minimize the time necessary to kill all the $$$n$$$ monsters?</p>",
