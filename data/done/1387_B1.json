Each road connects two houses and is exactly $$$1$$$ kilometer long. From each house it is possible to reach any other using one or several consecutive roads. In total there are $$$N-1$$$ roads in the village.</p><p>One day all villagers decided to move to different houses \u2014 that is, after moving each house should again have a single villager living in it, but no villager should be living in the same house as before. We would like to know the smallest possible total length in kilometers of the shortest paths between the old and the new houses for all villagers.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/dde7d9ac9e668121cdfc76f7d4e0a33ebc1152e5.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/><p>Example village with seven houses </p></center><p>For example, if there are seven houses connected by roads as shown on the figure, the smallest total length is $$$8$$$ km (this can be achieved by moving $$$1 \\to 6$$$, $$$2 \\to 4$$$, $$$3 \\to 1$$$, $$$4 \\to 2$$$, $$$5 \\to 7$$$, $$$6 \\to 3$$$, $$$7 \\to 5$$$).</p><p>Write a program that finds the smallest total length of the shortest paths in kilometers and an example assignment of the new houses to the villagers.</p>",
