But it's not that simple. Each number should have a length of $$$n$$$ (and should not have leading zeros), and the multiset of digits of all the numbers should be the same. For example, for $$$\\mathtt{234}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{432}$$$, and $$$\\mathtt{11223}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{32211}$$$, the multisets of digits are the same, but for $$$\\mathtt{123}$$$ and $$$\\mathtt{112233}$$$, they are not.</p><p>The mathematicians couldn't solve this problem.
