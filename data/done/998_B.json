In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.</p><p>There is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.</p><p>Cuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, $$$[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]$$$ $$$\\to$$$ two cuts $$$\\to$$$ $$$[4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5]$$$. On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.</p><p>The cost of the cut between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ numbers is $$$|x - y|$$$ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $$$B$$$ bitcoins.</p>",
