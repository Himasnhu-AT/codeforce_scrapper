Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.</p><p>Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b76c1f260511dd66537ab11c9f18a390a859d447.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.</p><p>Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.</p>",
