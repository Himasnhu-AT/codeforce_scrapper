    "statement": "<p>Creatnx has $$$n$$$ mirrors, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Every day, Creatnx asks exactly one mirror \"Am I beautiful?\". The $$$i$$$-th mirror will tell Creatnx that he is beautiful with probability $$$\\frac{p_i}{100}$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$.</p><p>Creatnx asks the mirrors one by one, starting from the $$$1$$$-st mirror. Every day, if he asks $$$i$$$-th mirror, there are two possibilities:</p><ul> <li> The $$$i$$$-th mirror tells Creatnx that he is beautiful. In this case, if $$$i = n$$$ Creatnx will stop and become happy, otherwise he will continue asking the $$$i+1$$$-th mirror next day; </li><li> In the other case, Creatnx will feel upset. The next day, Creatnx will start asking from the $$$1$$$-st mirror again. </li></ul><p>You need to calculate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\">the expected number</a> of days until Creatnx becomes happy.</p><p>This number should be found by modulo $$$998244353$$$. Formally, let $$$M = 998244353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x &lt; M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.</p>",
