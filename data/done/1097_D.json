    "statement": "<p>Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer $$$n$$$ written on it. He will perform the following action exactly $$$k$$$ times:</p><p>Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is $$$v$$$. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of $$$v$$$ (possibly $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$) and replace $$$v$$$ with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses $$$58$$$ as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.</p><p>He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps.</p><p>It can be shown that this value can be represented as $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \\cdot Q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>",
