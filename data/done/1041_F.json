Each line has some special integer points\u00a0\u2014 positions of sensors on sides of the tube.</p><p>You are going to emit a laser ray in the tube. To do so, you have to choose <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">two</span> integer points $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ on the first and the second line respectively (coordinates can be negative): the point $$$A$$$ is responsible for the position of the laser, and the point $$$B$$$\u00a0\u2014 for the direction of the laser ray. The laser ray is a ray starting at $$$A$$$ and directed at $$$B$$$ which will reflect from the sides of the tube (it doesn't matter if there are any sensors at a reflection point or not). A sensor will only register the ray if the ray hits exactly at the position of the sensor.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3f2f08b224328cd60021f6cbfd82094d1166a377.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Examples of laser rays.
