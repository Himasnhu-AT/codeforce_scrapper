The track which passes through this highway can be divided into $$$n$$$ sub-tracks. You are given an array $$$a$$$ where $$$a_i$$$ represents the number of traffic cars in the $$$i$$$-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1}^{n} \\lvert a_i-a_j\\rvert$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x$$$. </p><p>You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.</p><p>Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.</p>",
