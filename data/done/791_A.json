Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are <span class=\"tex-span\">36</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">28</span>, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>.</p><p>In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: <span class=\"tex-span\">12</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">18</span>, then <span class=\"tex-span\">36</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">36</span>, and finally <span class=\"tex-span\">108</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">72</span> (after three years). The answer is <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.</p><p>In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> then.</p>",
