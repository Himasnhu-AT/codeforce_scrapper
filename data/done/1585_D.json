    "statement": "<p>Petya has an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. He only likes sorted arrays. Unfortunately, the given array could be arbitrary, so Petya wants to sort it.</p><p>Petya likes to challenge himself, so he wants to sort array using only $$$3$$$-cycles. More formally, in one operation he can pick $$$3$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">pairwise distinct</span> indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i, j, k \\leq n$$$) and apply $$$i \\to j \\to k \\to i$$$ cycle to the array $$$a$$$. It simultaneously places $$$a_i$$$ on position $$$j$$$, $$$a_j$$$ on position $$$k$$$, and $$$a_k$$$ on position $$$i$$$, without changing any other element.</p><p>For example, if $$$a$$$ is $$$[10, 50, 20, 30, 40, 60]$$$ and he chooses $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 1$$$, $$$k = 5$$$, then the array becomes $$$[\\underline{50}, \\underline{40}, 20, 30, \\underline{10}, 60]$$$.</p><p>Petya can apply arbitrary number of $$$3$$$-cycles (possibly, zero). You are to determine if Petya can sort his array $$$a$$$, i.\u00a0e. make it non-decreasing.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" (without quotes) if Petya can sort the array $$$a$$$ using $$$3$$$-cycles, and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" (without quotes) otherwise.
