Each card contains two non-negative integers inscribed, one at the top of the card and one at the bottom. At the beginning of the round the player chooses one of his cards to play it. If the top of the card contains number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, and the bottom contains number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, then when the player is playing the card, he gets <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> points and also gets the opportunity to play additional <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> cards. After the playing the card is discarded.</p><p>More formally: let's say that there is a counter of the cards that can be played. At the beginning of the round the counter equals one. When a card is played, the counter decreases by one for the played card and increases by the number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, which is written at the bottom of the card. Then the played card is discarded. If after that the counter is not equal to zero, the player gets the opportunity to play another card from the remaining cards. The round ends when the counter reaches zero or the player runs out of cards.</p><p>Of course, Ilya wants to get as many points as possible. Can you determine the maximum number of points he can score provided that you know his cards?</p>",
