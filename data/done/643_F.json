The same barrel may be chosen by many bears. </li><li> Each bear drinks a glass from each barrel he chose. </li><li> All bears who drink wine go to sleep (exactly those bears who chose a barrel with wine). They will wake up many days after the party is over. If there are not enough places to sleep then bears lose immediately. </li></ol><p>At the end, if it's sure where wine is and there is at least one awake bear then bears win (unless they have lost before because of the number of places to sleep).</p><p>Radewoosh wants to allow bears to win.
