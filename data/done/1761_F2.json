In other words, the array is bad if, after sorting it, the element at $$$m+1$$$-st position remains the same.</p><p>Let's call a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">anti-median</span>, if every its subarray of odd length $$$\\ge 3$$$ is not bad.</p><p>You are already given values of some elements of the permutation. Find the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">anti-median</span> permutation. As this number can be very large, find it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>",
