    "statement": "<p>Polycarp and his friends want to visit a new restaurant. The restaurant has $$$n$$$ tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $$$n$$$ which contains characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" (the table is occupied) and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\" (the table is empty).</p><p>Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $$$k$$$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $$$i$$$, then all tables with numbers from $$$i-k$$$ to $$$i+k$$$ (except for the $$$i$$$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $$$k$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=8$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then:</p><ul> <li> strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10010001</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10000010</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00000000</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00100000</span>\" satisfy the rules of the restaurant; </li><li> strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10100100</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10011001</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">11111111</span>\" do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" with a distance less than or equal to $$$k=2$$$. </li></ul><p>In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" or a string with one \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.</p><p>You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string $$$s$$$.</p><p>Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\" that can be replaced by \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" such that the requirement will still be satisfied?</p><p>For example, if $$$n=6$$$, $$$k=1$$$, $$$s=$$$\u00a0\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">100010</span>\", then the answer to the problem will be $$$1$$$, since only the table at position $$$3$$$ can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of tables in the restaurant and the minimum allowed distance between two people.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\"\u00a0\u2014 a description of the free and occupied tables in the restaurant. The given string satisfy to the rules of the restaurant\u00a0\u2014 the difference between indices of any two \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" is more than $$$k$$$.</p><p>The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case output one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. If additional tables cannot be taken, then, obviously, you need to output $$$0$$$.</p>",
