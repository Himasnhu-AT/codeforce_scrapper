He faces an interesting problem related to an array of numbers.</p><p>Suppose Nikita has an array of integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He will call a subsequence$$$^\\dagger$$$ of the array <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">special</span> if its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple\">least common multiple (LCM)</a> is not contained in $$$a$$$. The LCM of an empty subsequence is equal to $$$0$$$.</p><p>Nikita wonders: what is the length of the longest <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">special</span> subsequence of $$$a$$$? Help him answer this question!</p><p>$$$^\\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, $$$[5,2,3]$$$ is a subsequence of $$$[1,5,7,8,2,4,3]$$$.</p>",
