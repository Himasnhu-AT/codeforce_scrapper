    "statement": "<p>Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: $$${0, 1, 2, \\dots}$$$. Given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^4$$$). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint $$$0$$$, then we paint $$$1$$$, then $$$2$$$ and so on.</p><p>Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number $$$i$$$ according to the following rules: </p><ul> <li> if $$$i = 0$$$, it is colored white;  </li><li> if $$$i \\ge a$$$ and $$$i - a$$$ is colored white, $$$i$$$ is also colored white;  </li><li> if $$$i \\ge b$$$ and $$$i - b$$$ is colored white, $$$i$$$ is also colored white;  </li><li> if $$$i$$$ is still not colored white, it is colored black. </li></ul><p>In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.</p><p>For example, if $$$a=3$$$, $$$b=5$$$, then the colors of the numbers (in the order from $$$0$$$) are: white ($$$0$$$), black ($$$1$$$), black ($$$2$$$), white ($$$3$$$), black ($$$4$$$), white ($$$5$$$), white ($$$6$$$), black ($$$7$$$), white ($$$8$$$), white ($$$9$$$), ...</p><p>Note that: </p><ul> <li> It is possible that there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, if $$$a = 10$$$ and $$$b = 10$$$, then only $$$0, 10, 20, 30$$$ and any other nonnegative integers that end in $$$0$$$ when written in base 10 are white. The other integers are colored black.  </li><li> It is also possible that there are only finitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, when $$$a = 1$$$ and $$$b = 10$$$, then there is no nonnegative integer colored black at all. </li></ul><p>Your task is to determine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">black</span> is infinite.</p><p>If there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black, simply print a line containing \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Infinite</span>\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Finite</span>\" (without the quotes).</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each line contains two space-separated integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^4$$$).</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print one line containing either \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Infinite</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Finite</span>\" (without the quotes). Output is case-insensitive (i.e. \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">infinite</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">inFiNite</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">finiTE</span>\" are all valid answers).</p>",
