It is, truth to be said, always eager to have something for dinner.</p><p>Its favorite meal is natural numbers (typically served with honey sauce), or, to be more precise, the zeros in their corresponding decimal representations. As for other digits, Krakozyabra dislikes them; moreover, they often cause it indigestion! So, as a necessary precaution, Krakozyabra prefers to sort the digits of a number in non-descending order before proceeding to feast. Then, the leading zeros of the resulting number are eaten and the remaining part is discarded as an <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">inedible tail</span>.</p><p>For example, if Krakozyabra is to have the number <span class=\"tex-span\">57040</span> for dinner, its <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">inedible tail</span> would be the number <span class=\"tex-span\">457</span>.</p><p>Slastyona is not really fond of the idea of Krakozyabra living in her castle. Hovewer, her natural hospitality prevents her from leaving her guest without food. Slastyona has a range of natural numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i></span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i></span>, which she is going to feed the guest with. Help her determine how many distinct <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">inedible tails</span> are going to be discarded by Krakozyabra by the end of the dinner.</p>",
