Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the $$$i$$$-th position. Thus each of $$$n$$$ positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.</p><p>She knows that exactly $$$m$$$ people will visit this exhibition. The $$$i$$$-th visitor will visit all flowers from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beauty</span> that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.</p><p>Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beauties</span> of all segments would be maximum possible.</p>",
