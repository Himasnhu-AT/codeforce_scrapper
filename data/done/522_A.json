    "statement": "<p>One day Polycarp published a funny picture in a social network making a poll about the color of his handle. Many of his friends started reposting Polycarp's joke to their news feed. Some of them reposted the reposts and so on.</p><p>These events are given as a sequence of strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name1</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">reposted</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name2</span>\", where <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name1</span> is the name of the person who reposted the joke, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name2</span> is the name of the person from whose news feed the joke was reposted. It is guaranteed that for each string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name1</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">reposted</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name2</span>\" user \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name1</span>\" didn't have the joke in his feed yet, and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">name2</span>\" already had it in his feed by the moment of repost. Polycarp was registered as \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Polycarp</span>\" and initially the joke was only in his feed.</p><p>Polycarp measures the popularity of the joke as the length of the largest repost chain.
