He decided to make a contest to gain a profit.</p><p>Vasya has $$$n$$$ problems to choose from. They are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The difficulty of the $$$i$$$-th problem is $$$d_i$$$. Moreover, the problems are given in the increasing order by their difficulties. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">The difficulties of all tasks are pairwise distinct</span>. In order to add the $$$i$$$-th problem to the contest you need to pay $$$c_i$$$ burles to its author. For each problem in the contest Vasya gets $$$a$$$ burles.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">In order to create a contest he needs to choose a consecutive subsegment of tasks</span>.</p><p>So the total earnings for the contest are calculated as follows: </p><ul> <li> if Vasya takes problem $$$i$$$ to the contest, he needs to pay $$$c_i$$$ to its author; </li><li> for each problem in the contest Vasya gets $$$a$$$ burles; </li><li> let $$$gap(l, r) = \\max\\limits_{l \\le i &lt; r} (d_{i + 1} - d_i)^2$$$. If Vasya takes all the tasks with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ to the contest, he also needs to pay $$$gap(l, r)$$$. If $$$l = r$$$ then $$$gap(l, r) = 0$$$. </li></ul><p>Calculate the maximum profit that Vasya can earn by taking a consecutive segment of tasks.</p>",
