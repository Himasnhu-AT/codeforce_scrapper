More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $$$i$$$-th voter is to pay him $$$p_i$$$ coins. The second way is to make $$$m_i$$$ other voters vote for you, and the $$$i$$$-th voter will vote for free.</p><p>Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $$$m_1 = 1$$$, $$$m_2 = 2$$$, $$$m_3 = 2$$$, $$$m_4 = 4$$$, $$$m_5 = 5$$$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: $$${5} \\rightarrow {1, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \\rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$$$.</p><p>Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.</p>",
