Both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ should be positive integers.</p><p>$$$LCM(a, b)$$$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$LCM(6, 8) = 24$$$, $$$LCM(4, 12) = 12$$$, $$$LCM(2, 3) = 6$$$.</p><p>Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?</p>",
