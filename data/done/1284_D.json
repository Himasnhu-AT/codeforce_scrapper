    "statement": "<p>Filled with optimism, Hyunuk will host a conference about how great this new year will be!</p><p>The conference will have $$$n$$$ lectures. Hyunuk has two candidate venues $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For each of the $$$n$$$ lectures, the speaker specified two time intervals $$$[sa_i, ea_i]$$$ ($$$sa_i \\le ea_i$$$) and $$$[sb_i, eb_i]$$$ ($$$sb_i \\le eb_i$$$). If the conference is situated in venue $$$a$$$, the lecture will be held from $$$sa_i$$$ to $$$ea_i$$$, and if the conference is situated in venue $$$b$$$, the lecture will be held from $$$sb_i$$$ to $$$eb_i$$$. Hyunuk will choose one of these venues and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> lectures will be held at that venue.</p><p>Two lectures are said to overlap if they share any point in time in common. Formally, a lecture held in interval $$$[x, y]$$$ overlaps with a lecture held in interval $$$[u, v]$$$ if and only if $$$\\max(x, u) \\le \\min(y, v)$$$.</p><p>We say that a participant can <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">attend</span> a subset $$$s$$$ of the lectures if the lectures in $$$s$$$ do not pairwise overlap (i.e. no two lectures overlap). Note that the possibility of attending may depend on whether Hyunuk selected venue $$$a$$$ or venue $$$b$$$ to hold the conference.</p><p>A subset of lectures $$$s$$$ is said to be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">venue-sensitive</span> if, for one of the venues, the participant can attend $$$s$$$, but for the other venue, the participant cannot attend $$$s$$$.</p><p>A venue-sensitive set is problematic for a participant who is interested in attending the lectures in $$$s$$$ because the participant cannot be sure whether the lecture times will overlap. Hyunuk will be happy if and only if there are no venue-sensitive sets. Determine whether Hyunuk will be happy.</p>",
