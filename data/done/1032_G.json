When a parrot with respect level $$$x$$$ starts chattering, $$$x$$$ neighbours to the right and to the left of it start repeating the same words in 1 second. Their neighbours then start repeating as well, and so on, until all the birds begin to chatter.</p><p>You are given the respect levels of all parrots. For each parrot answer a question: if this certain parrot starts chattering, how many seconds will pass until all other birds will start repeating it?</p>",
