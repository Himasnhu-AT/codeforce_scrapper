    "statement": "<p>Every December, VK traditionally holds an event for its employees named \"Secret Santa\". Here's how it happens.</p><p>$$$n$$$ employees numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ take part in the event. Each employee $$$i$$$ is assigned a different employee $$$b_i$$$, to which employee $$$i$$$ has to make a new year gift. Each employee is assigned to exactly one other employee, and nobody is assigned to themselves (but two employees may be assigned to each other). Formally, all $$$b_i$$$ must be distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, and for any $$$i$$$, $$$b_i \\ne i$$$ must hold.</p><p>The assignment is usually generated randomly. This year, as an experiment, all event participants have been asked who they wish to make a gift to. Each employee $$$i$$$ has said that they wish to make a gift to employee $$$a_i$$$.</p><p>Find a valid assignment $$$b$$$ that maximizes the number of fulfilled wishes of the employees.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$\u00a0($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of participants of the event.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$\u00a0($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$; $$$a_i \\ne i$$$)\u00a0\u2014 wishes of the employees in order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print two lines.</p><p>In the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$\u00a0($$$0 \\le k \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of fulfilled wishes in your assignment.</p><p>In the second line, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le n$$$; $$$b_i \\ne i$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of employees assigned to employees $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.</p><p>$$$k$$$ must be equal to the number of values of $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = b_i$$$, and must be as large as possible.
