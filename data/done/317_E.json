    "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Princess Vlada enjoys springing in the meadows and walking in the forest. One day \u2014 wonderful, sunny day \u2014 during her walk Princess found out with astonishment that her shadow was missing! \"Blimey!\", \u2014 she thought and started her search of the shadow in the forest.</span></p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Normally the Shadow is too lazy and simply sleeps under the Princess. But at this terrifically hot summer day she got bored of such a dull life, so she decided to play with Vlada.</span></p><p>The forest, where our characters entertain themselves, may be represented as a set of integer cells in the plane, where the Shadow and the Princess can move only up, down, left and right by <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. Some cells (as it happens in decent forests) are occupied by trees. The Shadow and the Princess are not allowed to enter a cell occupied by a tree. Unfortunately, these are the hard times for the forest, so there are very few trees growing here...</p><p>At first the Princess was walking within the cell (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>x</i></sub></span>,\u00a0<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>y</i></sub></span>), while the Shadow hid from the Princess in the cell (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>x</i></sub></span>,\u00a0<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>y</i></sub></span>). The Princess, The Shadow and the trees are located in the different cells.</p><p>The Shadow is playing with the Princess. As soon as the Princess moves by <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> in some direction, the Shadow simultaneously flies by <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> in the same direction, if it is possible (if the cell to fly to is not occupied by some tree); otherwise, the Shadow doesn't move. The Shadow is very shadowy, so our characters do not interfere with each other.</p><p>We say that the Shadow is caught by the Princess if after some move both of them are located in the same cell. Vlada managed to catch her Shadow! Can you?</p>",
