    "statement": "<p>Piegirl is buying stickers for a project. Stickers come on sheets, and each sheet of stickers contains exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> stickers. Each sticker has exactly one character printed on it, so a sheet of stickers can be described by a string of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Piegirl wants to create a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> using stickers. She may buy as many sheets of stickers as she wants, and may specify any string of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> for the sheets, but all the sheets must be identical, so the string is the same for all sheets. Once she attains the sheets of stickers, she will take some of the stickers from the sheets and arrange (in any order) them to form <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. Determine the minimum number of sheets she has to buy, and provide a string describing a possible sheet of stickers she should buy.</p>",
