    "statement": "<p>You are an environmental activist at heart but the reality is harsh and you are just a cashier in a cinema. But you can still do something!</p><p>You have $$$n$$$ tickets to sell. The price of the $$$i$$$-th ticket is $$$p_i$$$. As a teller, you have a possibility to select the order in which the tickets will be sold (i.e. a permutation of the tickets). You know that the cinema participates in two ecological restoration programs applying them <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to the order you chose</span>:</p><ul> <li> The $$$x\\%$$$ of the price of each the $$$a$$$-th sold ticket ($$$a$$$-th, $$$2a$$$-th, $$$3a$$$-th and so on) <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">in the order you chose</span> is aimed for research and spreading of renewable energy sources. </li><li> The $$$y\\%$$$ of the price of each the $$$b$$$-th sold ticket ($$$b$$$-th, $$$2b$$$-th, $$$3b$$$-th and so on) <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">in the order you chose</span> is aimed for pollution abatement. </li></ul><p>If the ticket is in both programs then the $$$(x + y) \\%$$$ are used for environmental activities. Also, it's known that all prices are multiples of $$$100$$$, so there is no need in any rounding.</p><p>For example, if you'd like to sell tickets with prices $$$[400, 100, 300, 200]$$$ and the cinema pays $$$10\\%$$$ of each $$$2$$$-nd sold ticket and $$$20\\%$$$ of each $$$3$$$-rd sold ticket, then arranging them in order $$$[100, 200, 300, 400]$$$ will lead to contribution equal to $$$100 \\cdot 0 + 200 \\cdot 0.1 + 300 \\cdot 0.2 + 400 \\cdot 0.1 = 120$$$. But arranging them in order $$$[100, 300, 400, 200]$$$ will lead to $$$100 \\cdot 0 + 300 \\cdot 0.1 + 400 \\cdot 0.2 + 200 \\cdot 0.1 = 130$$$.</p><p>Nature can't wait, so you decided to change the order of tickets in such a way, so that the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">total</span> contribution to programs will reach at least $$$k$$$ in <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of sold tickets. Or say that it's impossible to do so. In other words, find the minimum number of tickets which are needed to be sold in order to earn at least $$$k$$$.</p>",
