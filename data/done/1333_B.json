    "statement": "<p>Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem:</p><p>There are two arrays of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It turned out that array $$$a$$$ contains only elements from the set $$$\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$$$.</p><p>Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:</p><ol> <li> Choose any pair of indexes $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i &lt; j \\le n$$$. It is possible to choose the same pair $$$(i, j)$$$ more than once.  </li><li> Add $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_j$$$. In other words, $$$j$$$-th element of the array becomes equal to $$$a_i + a_j$$$. </li></ol><p>For example, if you are given array $$$[1, -1, 0]$$$, you can transform it only to $$$[1, -1, -1]$$$, $$$[1, 0, 0]$$$ and $$$[1, -1, 1]$$$ by one operation.</p><p>Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $$$a$$$ so that it becomes equal to array $$$b$$$. Can you help him?</p>",
