The program was supposed to do the following: in the given string, consisting if uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, it: </p><ul> <li> deletes all the vowels, </li><li> inserts a character \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span>\" before each consonant, </li><li> replaces all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones. </li></ul><p>Vowels are letters \"A\", \"O\", \"Y\", \"E\", \"U\", \"I\", and the rest are consonants. The program's input is exactly one string, it should return the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing the initial string.</p><p>Help Petya cope with this easy task.</p>",
