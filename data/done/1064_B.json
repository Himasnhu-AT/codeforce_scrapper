Monday starts on Saturday</div></div><p>Reading the book \"Equations of Mathematical Magic\" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: $$$a - (a \\oplus x) - x = 0$$$ for some given $$$a$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">^</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">xor</span> in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some $$$x$$$, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-negative</span> solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.</p>",
