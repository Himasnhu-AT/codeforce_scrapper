    "statement": "<p>Modern researches has shown that a flock of hungry mice searching for a piece of cheese acts as follows: if there are several pieces of cheese then each mouse chooses the closest one. After that all mice start moving towards the chosen piece of cheese. When a mouse or several mice achieve the destination point and there is still a piece of cheese in it, they eat it and become well-fed. Each mice that reaches this point after that remains hungry. Moving speeds of all mice are equal.</p><p>If there are several ways to choose closest pieces then mice will choose it in a way that would minimize the number of hungry mice. To check this theory scientists decided to conduct an experiment. They located <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> mice and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>M</i></span> pieces of cheese on a cartesian plane where all mice are located on the line <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i>\u2009=\u2009<i>Y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub></span> and all pieces of cheese \u2014 on another line <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i>\u2009=\u2009<i>Y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span>. To check the results of the experiment the scientists need a program which simulates the behavior of a flock of hungry mice.</p><p>Write a program that computes the minimal number of mice which will remain hungry, i.e. without cheese.</p>",
