Luntik calls a subsequence of the array $$$a$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">nearly full</span> if the sum of the numbers in that subsequence is equal to $$$s-1$$$.</p><p>Luntik really wants to know the number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">nearly full</span> subsequences of the array $$$a$$$. But he needs to come home so he asks you to solve that problem!</p><p>A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.</p>",

The description of each test case consists of two lines.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 60$$$) \u2014 the length of the array.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.</p>",
