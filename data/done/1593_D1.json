Polycarp conceived of a positive integer $$$k$$$. After that, Polycarp began performing the following operations on the array: take an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and reduce the number $$$a_i$$$ by $$$k$$$.</p><p>After Polycarp performed some (possibly zero) number of such operations, it turned out that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> numbers in the array became the same.
