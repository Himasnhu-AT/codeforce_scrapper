You have a so-called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">XOR-gun</span> that you can use one or more times.</p><p>In one step you can select two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consecutive</span> elements of the array, let's say $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, remove them from the array and insert the integer $$$x \\oplus y$$$ on their place, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR operation</a>. Note that the length of the array decreases by one after the operation. You can't perform this operation when the length of the array reaches one.</p><p>For example, if the array is $$$[2, 5, 6, 8]$$$, you can select $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ and replace them with $$$5 \\oplus 6 = 3$$$. The array becomes $$$[2, 3, 8]$$$.</p><p>You want the array no longer be non-decreasing. What is the minimum number of steps needed? If the array stays non-decreasing no matter what you do, print $$$-1$$$.</p>",
