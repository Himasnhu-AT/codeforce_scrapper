He remembers that all written strings were lexicographically <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not smaller</span> than string $$$s$$$ and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not bigger</span> than string $$$t$$$. He is interested: what is the maximum value of $$$c$$$ that he could get.</p><p>A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:</p><ul><li> $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$;</li><li> in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.</li></ul>",
