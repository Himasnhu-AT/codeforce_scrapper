After the removing, it is forbidden to rearrange the digits.</p><p>If a solution exists, you should print it.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" (without quotes), if there is no such way to remove some digits from number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. </p><p>Otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" in the first line and the resulting number after removing digits from number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> in the second line. The printed number must be divisible by <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span>.</p><p>If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.</p>",
