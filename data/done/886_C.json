Since Petya is not really experienced, his exploration is just walking through the catacombs.</p><p>Catacombs consist of several rooms and bidirectional passages between some pairs of them. Some passages can connect a room to itself and since the passages are built on different depths they do not intersect each other. Every minute Petya arbitrary chooses a passage from the room he is currently in and then reaches the room on the other end of the passage in exactly one minute. When he enters a room at minute <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>, he makes a note in his logbook with number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>: </p><ul> <li> If Petya has visited this room before, he writes down the minute he was in this room last time; </li><li> Otherwise, Petya writes down an arbitrary non-negative integer strictly less than current minute <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>. </li></ul><p>Initially, Petya was in one of the rooms at minute <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>, he didn't write down number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub></span>.</p><p>At some point during his wandering Petya got tired, threw out his logbook and went home.
