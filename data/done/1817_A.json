The whole subarray is a almost-increasing, because there are no three consecutive elements such that $$$x \\geq y \\geq z$$$. So the answer is $$$4$$$.</p><p>In the third query, the subarray is $$$a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 = [2, 4, 3, 3]$$$. The whole subarray is not almost-increasing, because the last three elements satisfy $$$4 \\geq 3 \\geq 3$$$. An almost-increasing subsequence of length $$$3$$$ can be found (for example taking $$$a_2,a_3,a_5 = [2,4,3]$$$ ). So the answer is $$$3$$$.</p>",
