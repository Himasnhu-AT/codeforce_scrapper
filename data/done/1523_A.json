For simplicity, William decided to define his cellular automaton on an array containing $$$n$$$ cells, with each cell either being alive or dead.</p><p>Evolution of the array in William's cellular automaton occurs iteratively in the following way:</p><ul> <li> If the element is dead and it has <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$1$$$ alive neighbor <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">in the current state of the array</span>, then on the next iteration it will become alive. For an element at index $$$i$$$ the neighbors would be elements with indices $$$i - 1$$$ and $$$i + 1$$$. If there is no element at that index, it is considered to be a dead neighbor. </li><li> William is a humane person so all alive elements stay alive. </li></ul><p>Check the note section for examples of the evolution.</p><p>You are given some initial state of all elements and you need to help William find the state of the array after $$$m$$$ iterations of evolution.</p>",
