Every unit type has three parameters: </p><ul> <li> $$$c_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the cost of recruiting one unit of the $$$i$$$-th type; </li><li> $$$d_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the damage that one unit of the $$$i$$$-th type deals in a second; </li><li> $$$h_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the amount of health of one unit of the $$$i$$$-th type. </li></ul><p>Monocarp has to face $$$m$$$ monsters.

He wants all his recruited units to stay alive. Both Monocarp's squad and the monster attack continuously (not once per second) and at the same time. Thus, Monocarp wins the battle if and only if his squad kills the monster strictly faster than the monster kills one of his units. The time is compared with no rounding.</p><p>For each monster, Monocarp wants to know the minimum amount of coins he has to spend to kill that monster. If this amount is greater than $$$C$$$, then report that it's impossible to kill that monster.</p>",
