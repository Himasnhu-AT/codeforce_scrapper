    "statement": "<p>Michael and Brian are stuck in a hotel with $$$n$$$ rooms, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and need to find each other. But this hotel's doors are all locked and the only way of getting around is by using the teleporters in each room. Room $$$i$$$ has a teleporter that will take you to room $$$a_i$$$ (it might be that $$$a_i = i$$$). But they don't know the values of $$$a_1,a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$.</p><p>Instead, they can call up the front desk to ask queries. In one query, they give a room $$$u$$$, a positive integer $$$k$$$, and a set of rooms $$$S$$$. The hotel concierge answers whether a person starting in room $$$u$$$, and using the teleporters $$$k$$$ times, ends up in a room in $$$S$$$.</p><p>Brian is in room $$$1$$$. Michael wants to know the set $$$A$$$ of rooms so that if he starts in one of those rooms they can use the teleporters to meet up. He can ask at most $$$2000$$$ queries.</p><p>The values $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ are fixed before the start of the interaction and do not depend on your queries. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.</p>",
