    "statement": "<p>Monocarp has drawn a tree (an undirected connected acyclic graph) and then has given each vertex an index. All indices are distinct numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. For every edge $$$e$$$ of this tree, Monocarp has written two numbers: the maximum indices of the vertices of the two components formed if the edge $$$e$$$ (and only this edge) is erased from the tree.</p><p>Monocarp has given you a list of $$$n - 1$$$ pairs of numbers. He wants you to provide an example of a tree that will produce the said list if this tree exists. If such tree does not exist, say so.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 1\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ each ($$$1 \\le a_i &lt; b_i \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the maximal indices of vertices in the components formed if the $$$i$$$-th edge is removed.</p>",

Each of the last $$$n - 1$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i, y_i \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 vertices connected by an edge.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note: The numeration of edges doesn't matter for this task. Your solution will be considered correct if your tree produces the same pairs as given in the input file (possibly reordered).
