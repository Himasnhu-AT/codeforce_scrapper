    "statement": "<p>On March 14, the day of the number $$$\\pi$$$ is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.</p><p>Polycarp was told at school that the number $$$\\pi$$$ is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number $$$\\pi$$$ by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.</p><p>Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered $$$\\pi$$$ as $$$3.1415$$$, he wrote out <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">31415</span>.</p><p>Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp actually remembers correctly.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. </p><p>Each test case is described by a single string of digits $$$n$$$, which was written out by Polycarp.</p><p>The string $$$n$$$ contains up to $$$30$$$ digits.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output $$$t$$$ integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp remembers correctly.</p>",
