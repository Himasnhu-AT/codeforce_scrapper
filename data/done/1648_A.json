    "statement": "<p>Egor has a table of size $$$n \\times m$$$, with lines numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and columns numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. Each cell has a color that can be presented as an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^5$$$.</p><p>Let us denote the cell that lies in the intersection of the $$$r$$$-th row and the $$$c$$$-th column as $$$(r, c)$$$. We define the <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">manhattan distance</span> between two cells $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ as the length of a shortest path between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common side. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table $$$3 \\times 4$$$ the manhattan distance between $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 3)$$$ is $$$3$$$, one of the shortest paths is the following: $$$(1, 2) \\to (2, 2) \\to (2, 3) \\to (3, 3)$$$. </p><p>Egor decided to calculate the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to calculate this sum.</p>",
