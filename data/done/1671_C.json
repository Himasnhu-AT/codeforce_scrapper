There are $$$n$$$ shops around that sell sugar: the $$$i$$$-th shop sells one pack of sugar for $$$a_i$$$ coins, but only <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one pack to one customer</span> each day. So in order to buy several packs, you need to visit several shops.</p><p>Another problem is that prices are increasing each day: during the first day the cost is $$$a_i$$$, during the second day cost is $$$a_i + 1$$$, during the third day\u00a0\u2014 $$$a_i + 2$$$ and so on for each shop $$$i$$$.</p><p>On the contrary, your everyday budget is only $$$x$$$ coins. In other words, each day you go and buy as many packs as possible with total cost not exceeding $$$x$$$. Note that if you don't spend some amount of coins during a day, you can't use these coins during the next days.</p><p>Eventually, the cost for each pack will exceed $$$x$$$, and you won't be able to buy even a single pack. So, how many packs will you be able to buy till that moment in total?</p>",
