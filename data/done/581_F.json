    "statement": "<p>It's election time in Berland. The favorites are of course parties of zublicanes and mumocrates. The election campaigns of both parties include numerous demonstrations on <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> main squares of the capital of Berland. Each of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> squares certainly can have demonstrations of only one party, otherwise it could lead to riots. On the other hand, both parties have applied to host a huge number of demonstrations, so that on all squares demonstrations must be held. Now the capital management will distribute the area between the two parties.</p><p>Some pairs of squares are connected by <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091)</span> bidirectional roads such that between any pair of squares there is a unique way to get from one square to another. Some squares are on the outskirts of the capital meaning that they are connected by a road with only one other square, such squares are called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">dead end</span> squares.</p><p>The mayor of the capital instructed to distribute all the squares between the parties so that the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">dead end</span> squares had the same number of demonstrations of the first and the second party. It is guaranteed that the number of dead end squares of the city is even.</p><p>To prevent possible conflicts between the zublicanes and the mumocrates it was decided to minimize the number of roads connecting the squares with the distinct parties. You, as a developer of the department of distributing squares, should determine this smallest number.</p>",
