The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.</span></p><p>Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size $$$n \\times m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9$$$), the rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is denoted as ($$$r, c$$$).</p><p>Bob has $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:</p><ul> <li> To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">down</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">right</span>. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. </li><li> Alice's path will divide the field into two parts \u2014 one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part \u2014 to Bob. </li><li> Alice will own the part that includes the cell ($$$n, 1$$$). </li><li> Bob will own the part that includes the cell ($$$1, m$$$). </li></ul><p>Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.</p><p>Bob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer $$$\\alpha$$$ \u2014 the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot). Then output $$$k$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$, where:</p><ul> <li> $$$a_i=0$$$, if after Bob gives Alice the $$$i$$$-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to $$$\\alpha$$$); </li><li> $$$a_i=1$$$, if after Bob gives Alice the $$$i$$$-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than $$$\\alpha$$$). </li></ul>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n, m \\le 10^9$$$, $$$2 \\le k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.</p><p>Then follow $$$k$$$ lines, each containing two numbers $$$r_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le c_i \\le m$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of the cell with the $$$i$$$-th fountain. It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is ($$$n, 1$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, first output $$$\\alpha$$$\u00a0\u2014 the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output $$$k$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$, where:</p><ul> <li> $$$a_i=0$$$, if after Bob gives Alice the $$$i$$$-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all $$$k$$$ fountains belong to Bob; </li><li> $$$a_i=1$$$, if after Bob gives Alice the $$$i$$$-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all $$$k$$$ fountains belong to Bob. </li></ul><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">If you output any other positive number instead of $$$1$$$ that fits into a 64-bit signed integer type, it will also be recognized as $$$1$$$. Thus, a solution to the hard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.</span></p>",
