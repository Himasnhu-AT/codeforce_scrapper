    "statement": "<p>On a weekend, Qingshan suggests that she and her friend Daniel go hiking. Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.</p><p>A permutation $$$p$$$ is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le n$$$) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le y\\le n$$$, $$$y \\ne x$$$).</p><p>The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow: </p><ul> <li> If it is Qingshan's turn, Qingshan must change $$$x$$$ to such an index $$$x'$$$ that $$$1\\le x'\\le n$$$, $$$|x'-x|=1$$$, $$$x'\\ne y$$$, and $$$p_{x'}&lt;p_x$$$ at the same time. </li><li> If it is Daniel's turn, Daniel must change $$$y$$$ to such an index $$$y'$$$ that $$$1\\le y'\\le n$$$, $$$|y'-y|=1$$$, $$$y'\\ne x$$$, and $$$p_{y'}&gt;p_y$$$ at the same time. </li></ul><p>The person who can't make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible $$$x$$$ to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the permutation.</p>",

In the first turn (Qingshan's) Qingshan chooses $$$x'=3$$$ and changes $$$x$$$ to $$$3$$$. In the second turn (Daniel's) Daniel chooses $$$y'=2$$$ and changes $$$y$$$ to $$$2$$$. Qingshan can't choose $$$x'=2$$$ because $$$y=2$$$ at this time. Then Qingshan loses.</p>",
