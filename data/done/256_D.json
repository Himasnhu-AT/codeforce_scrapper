    "statement": "<p>There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> people, sitting in a line at the table. For each person we know that he always tells either the truth or lies.</p><p>Little Serge asked them: how many of you always tell the truth? Each of the people at the table knows everything (who is an honest person and who is a liar) about all the people at the table. The honest people are going to say the correct answer, the liars are going to say any integer from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, which is not the correct answer. Every liar chooses his answer, regardless of the other liars, so two distinct liars may give distinct answer.</p><p>Serge does not know any information about the people besides their answers to his question. He took a piece of paper and wrote <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>n</i></sub></span>, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> is the answer of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th person in the row. Given this sequence, Serge determined that exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> people sitting at the table <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">apparently lie</span>.</p><p>Serge wonders, how many variants of people's answers (sequences of answers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>) there are where one can say that exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> people sitting at the table apparently lie. As there can be rather many described variants of answers, count the remainder of dividing the number of the variants by <span class=\"tex-span\">777777777</span>.</p>",
