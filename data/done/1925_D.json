The $$$i$$$-th pair who are friends have a friendship value of $$$f_i$$$. </p><p>The teacher has to go for $$$k$$$ excursions, and for each of the excursions she chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by $$$1$$$ for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered $$$0$$$, and it does not change for subsequent excursions. </p><p>Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all $$$k$$$ pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this answer can always be expressed as a fraction $$$\\dfrac{p}{q}$$$ where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are coprime integers. Calculate $$$p\\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod (10^9+7)$$$.</p>",
