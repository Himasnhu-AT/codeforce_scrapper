    "statement": "<p>The Looksery company, consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> staff members, is planning another big party. Every employee has his phone number and the phone numbers of his friends in the phone book. Everyone who comes to the party, sends messages to his contacts about how cool it is. At the same time everyone is trying to spend as much time on the fun as possible, so they send messages to everyone without special thinking, moreover, each person even sends a message <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to himself or herself</span>.</p><p>Igor and Max, Looksery developers, started a dispute on how many messages each person gets. Igor indicates <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> numbers, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th of which indicates how many messages, in his view, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th employee is going to take. If Igor guesses correctly at least one of these numbers, he wins, otherwise Max wins.</p><p>You support Max in this debate, so you need, given the contact lists of the employees, to determine whether there is a situation where Igor loses. Specifically, you need to determine which employees should come to the party, and which should not, so after all the visitors send messages to their contacts, each employee received a number of messages that is different from what Igor stated.</p>",
