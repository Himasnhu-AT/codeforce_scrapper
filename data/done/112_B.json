    "statement": "<p>Little Petya loves playing with squares. Mum bought him a square <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u20092<i>n</i></span> in size. Petya marked a cell inside the square and now he is solving the following task.</p><p>The task is to draw a broken line that would go along the grid lines and that would cut the square into two equal parts. The cutting line should not have any common points with the marked cell and the resulting two parts should be equal <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">up to rotation</span>.</p><p>Petya wants to determine whether it is possible to cut the square in the required manner given the sizes of the square side and the coordinates of the marked cell. Help him.</p>",

It is guaranteed that <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>n</i></span> is even.</p><p>The coordinates of the marked cell are represented by a pair of numbers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span>, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> represents the number of the row and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span> represents the number of the column.
