    "statement": "<p>Stepan has a very big positive integer.</p><p>Let's consider all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer (if we look at his integer like at a string) which are also integers (i.e. they <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">do not have</span> leading zeros). Let's call such shifts as <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">good shifts</span>. For example, for the integer <span class=\"tex-span\">10203</span> the good shifts are the integer itself <span class=\"tex-span\">10203</span> and integers <span class=\"tex-span\">20310</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">31020</span>.</p><p>Stepan wants to know the minimum remainder of the division by the given number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> among all good shifts. Your task is to determine the minimum remainder of the division by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>.</p>",
