Now Bob has a string, where all addresses are written one after another without any separators, and there is impossible to determine, where the boundaries between addresses are. Unfortunately, on the same day his chief asked him to bring the initial list of addresses. Now Bob wants to disjoin addresses in some valid way. Help him to do that.</p>",
