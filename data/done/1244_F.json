    "statement": "<p>There are $$$n$$$ chips arranged in a circle, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. </p><p>Initially each chip has black or white color. Then $$$k$$$ iterations occur. During each iteration the chips change their colors according to the following rules. For each chip $$$i$$$, three chips are considered: chip $$$i$$$ itself and two its neighbours. If the number of white chips among these three is greater than the number of black chips among these three chips, then the chip $$$i$$$ becomes white. Otherwise, the chip $$$i$$$ becomes black. </p><p>Note that for each $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$(n - 1)$$$ two neighbouring chips have numbers $$$(i - 1)$$$ and $$$(i + 1)$$$. The neighbours for the chip $$$i = 1$$$ are $$$n$$$ and $$$2$$$. The neighbours of $$$i = n$$$ are $$$(n - 1)$$$ and $$$1$$$.</p><p>The following picture describes one iteration with $$$n = 6$$$. The chips $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ are initially black, and the chips $$$2$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ are white. After the iteration $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ become black, and $$$1$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$6$$$ become white.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/2ee8ad370f00822cb1b9fe80ece3650f639239d6.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Your task is to determine the color of each chip after $$$k$$$ iterations.</p>",
