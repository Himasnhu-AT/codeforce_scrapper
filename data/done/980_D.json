For a given array of integers, the problem asks to find the minimum number of groups the array can be divided into, such that the product of any pair of integers in the same group is a perfect square. </p><p>Each integer must be in exactly one group. However, integers in a group do not necessarily have to be contiguous in the array.</p><p>SaMer wishes to create more cases from the test case he already has. His test case has an array $$$A$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, and he needs to find the number of contiguous subarrays of $$$A$$$ that have an answer to the problem equal to $$$k$$$ for each integer $$$k$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ (inclusive).</p>",
