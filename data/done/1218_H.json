In other words, value $$$F(i, m)$$$ represents composition $$$A[...A[i]]$$$ applied $$$m$$$ times.</p><p>You are given an array of length $$$N$$$ with non-negative integers. You are expected to give an answer on $$$Q$$$ queries. Each query consists of two numbers \u2013 $$$m$$$ and $$$y$$$. For each query determine how many $$$x$$$ exist such that $$$F(x,m) = y$$$.</p>",
