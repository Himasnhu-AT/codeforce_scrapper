    "statement": "<p>One day Maria Ivanovna found a Sasha's piece of paper with a message dedicated to Olya. Maria Ivanovna wants to know what is there in a message, but unfortunately the message is ciphered. Maria Ivanovna knows that her students usually cipher their messages by replacing each letter of an original message by some another letter. Replacement works in such way that same letters are always replaced with some fixed letter, and different letters are always replaced by different letters. </p><p>Maria Ivanovna supposed that the message contains answers to the final exam (since its length is equal to the number of final exam questions). On the other hand she knows that Sasha's answer are not necessary correct. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>K</i></span> possible answers for each questions. Of course, Maria Ivanovna knows correct answers.</p><p>Maria Ivanovna decided to decipher message in such way that the number of Sasha's correct answers is maximum possible. She is very busy now, so your task is to help her.</p>",
