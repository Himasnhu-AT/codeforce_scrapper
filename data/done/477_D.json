    "statement": "<p>Dreamoon saw a large integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> written on the ground and wants to print its binary form out. Dreamoon has accomplished the part of turning <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> into its binary format. Now he is going to print it in the following manner.</p><p>He has an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009=\u20090</span> and can only perform the following two operations in any order for unlimited times each:</p><ol> <li> Print n in binary form without leading zeros, each print will append to the right of previous prints. </li><li> Increase n by 1. </li></ol><p>Let's define an <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">ideal sequence</span> as a sequence of operations that can successfully print binary representation of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> without leading zeros and ends with a print operation (i.e. operation 1). Dreamoon wants to know how many different ideal sequences are there and the length (in operations) of the shortest ideal sequence.</p><p>The answers might be large so please print them modulo 1000000007 (<span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097</span>).</p><p>Let's define the string representation of an ideal sequence as a string of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'1'</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">'2'</span> where the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th character in the string matches the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th operation performed.
