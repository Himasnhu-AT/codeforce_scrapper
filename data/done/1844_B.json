For example, $$$2,5,13$$$ are prime numbers, but $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ are not prime numbers. </li><li> A permutation of $$$1,2,\\dots,n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). </li></ul>",
