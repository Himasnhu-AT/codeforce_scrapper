    "statement": "<p>A chainword is a special type of crossword. As most of the crosswords do, it has cells that you put the letters in and some sort of hints to what these letters should be.</p><p>The letter cells in a chainword are put in a single row. We will consider chainwords of length $$$m$$$ in this task.</p><p>A hint to a chainword is a sequence of segments such that the segments don't intersect with each other and cover all $$$m$$$ letter cells. Each segment contains a description of the word in the corresponding cells.</p><p>The twist is that there are actually two hints: one sequence is the row above the letter cells and the other sequence is the row below the letter cells. When the sequences are different, they provide a way to resolve the ambiguity in the answers.</p><p>You are provided with a dictionary of $$$n$$$ words, each word consists of lowercase Latin letters. All words are pairwise distinct.</p><p>An instance of a chainword is the following triple: </p><ul> <li> a string of $$$m$$$ lowercase Latin letters; </li><li> the first hint: a sequence of segments such that the letters that correspond to each segment spell a word from the dictionary; </li><li> the second hint: another sequence of segments such that the letters that correspond to each segment spell a word from the dictionary. </li></ul><p>Note that the sequences of segments don't necessarily have to be distinct.</p><p>Two instances of chainwords are considered different if they have different strings, different first hints <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">or</span> different second hints.</p><p>Count the number of different instances of chainwords. Since the number might be pretty large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
