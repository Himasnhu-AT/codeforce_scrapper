Amr wants to collect apples from the apple trees. Amr currently stands in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009=\u20090</span> position. At the beginning, he can choose whether to go right or left. He'll continue in his direction until he meets an apple tree he didn't visit before. He'll take all of its apples and then reverse his direction, continue walking in this direction until he meets another apple tree he didn't visit before and so on. In the other words, Amr reverses his direction when visiting each new apple tree. Amr will stop collecting apples when there are no more trees he didn't visit in the direction he is facing.</p><p>What is the maximum number of apples he can collect?</p>",
