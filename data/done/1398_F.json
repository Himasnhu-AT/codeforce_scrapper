Each round is won either by Alice or by Bob, and the set ends when one of the players has won $$$x$$$ rounds in a row. For example, if Bob won five rounds in a row and $$$x = 2$$$, then two sets ends.</p><p>You know that Alice and Bob have already played $$$n$$$ rounds, and you know the results of some rounds. For each $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, calculate the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of the players wins $$$x$$$ rounds in a row. It is possible that the last set is still not finished \u2014 in that case, you should not count it in the answer.</p>",
