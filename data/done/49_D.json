Vasya takes a stripe consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>n</i></span> square and paints the squares black and white. After that Petya can start moves \u2014 during a move he may choose any two neighboring squares of one color and repaint these two squares any way he wants, perhaps in different colors. Petya can only repaint the squares in white and black colors. Petya\u2019s aim is to repaint the stripe so that no two neighboring squares were of one color. Help Petya, using the given initial coloring, find the minimum number of moves Petya needs to win.</p>",
