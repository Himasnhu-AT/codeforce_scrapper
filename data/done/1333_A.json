Medina is very busy, that's why she asked for your help.</p><p>Artem wants to paint an $$$n \\times m$$$ board. Each cell of the board should be colored in white or black. </p><p>Lets $$$B$$$ be the number of black cells that have at least one white neighbor adjacent by the side. Let $$$W$$$ be the number of white cells that have at least one black neighbor adjacent by the side. A coloring is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">good</span> if $$$B = W + 1$$$. </p><p>The first coloring shown below has $$$B=5$$$ and $$$W=4$$$ (all cells have at least one neighbor with the opposite color). However, the second coloring is not <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">good</span> as it has $$$B=4$$$, $$$W=4$$$ (only the bottom right cell doesn't have a neighbor with the opposite color).</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5611f0803c61268019d39e2781107538b4c56aeb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Please, help Medina to find any <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">good</span> coloring.
