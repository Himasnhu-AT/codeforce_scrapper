    "statement": "<p>Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cards. He has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> identical decks of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.</p><p>The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.</p><p>You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.</p>",
