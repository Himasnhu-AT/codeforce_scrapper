    "statement": "<p>You've got a job in a game studio that developed an online shooter, and your first big task is to help to balance weapons. The game has $$$n$$$ weapons: the $$$i$$$-th gun has an integer fire rate $$$f_i$$$ and an integer damage per bullet $$$d_i$$$. The $$$i$$$-th gun's total firepower is equal to $$$p_i = f_i \\cdot d_i$$$.</p><p>You have to modify the values $$$d_i$$$ of some guns in such a way that the new values $$$d_i$$$ will still be integers, and the firepower of all guns will become balanced. Given an integer $$$k$$$, the guns are said to be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">balanced</span> if $$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}{p_i} - \\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n}{p_i} \\le k$$$.</p><p>Since gamers that play your game don't like big changes, you need to change the values $$$d_i$$$ for the minimum possible number of guns. What is the minimum number of guns for which you have to change these values to make the guns balanced?</p><p>Note that the new values $$$d_i$$$ must be integers greater than $$$0$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 3000$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 1500$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of guns to balance, and the maximum allowed gap between the most and the least powerful weapons.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le f_i \\le 2000$$$), where $$$f_i$$$ is the fire rate of the $$$i$$$-th gun.</p><p>The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9$$$), where $$$d_i$$$ is the damage per bullet of the $$$i$$$-th gun.</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print the minimum number of guns which damage $$$d_i$$$ you have to change in order to make the guns balanced.</p><p>Note that the new values $$$d_i$$$ must be integers greater than $$$0$$$.</p>",

The guns are balanced, since $$$14 - 12 \\le 2$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, you have to change the value $$$d_i$$$ for all three guns. For example, you can set $$$d = [5151, 5100, 5050]$$$.</p><p>In the third test case, all guns are already balanced, so you don't have to change anything.</p>",
