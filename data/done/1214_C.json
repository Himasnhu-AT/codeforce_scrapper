Petya was quite disappointed with his gift, because he dreamed of correct bracket sequence, yet he told his friends nothing about his dreams and decided to fix present himself. </p><p>To make everything right, Petya is going to move at most one bracket from its original place in the sequence to any other position. Reversing the bracket (e.g. turning \"(\" into \")\" or vice versa) isn't allowed. </p><p>We remind that bracket sequence $$$s$$$ is called correct if: </p><ul> <li> $$$s$$$ is empty; </li><li> $$$s$$$ is equal to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(</span>$$$t$$$<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)</span>\", where $$$t$$$ is correct bracket sequence; </li><li> $$$s$$$ is equal to $$$t_1 t_2$$$, i.e. concatenation of $$$t_1$$$ and $$$t_2$$$, where $$$t_1$$$ and $$$t_2$$$ are correct bracket sequences. </li></ul><p>For example, \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(()())</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()</span>\" are correct, while \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)(</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">())</span>\" are not.
