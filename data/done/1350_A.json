    "statement": "<p>Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.</p><p>For two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, $$$a$$$ is a divisor of $$$b$$$ if and only if there exists an integer $$$c$$$, such that $$$a\\cdot c=b$$$.</p><p>For $$$n \\ge 2$$$, we will denote as $$$f(n)$$$ the smallest positive divisor of $$$n$$$, except $$$1$$$.</p><p>For example, $$$f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5$$$.</p><p>For the fixed integer $$$n$$$, Orac decided to add $$$f(n)$$$ to $$$n$$$. </p><p>For example, if he had an integer $$$n=5$$$, the new value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$10$$$. And if he had an integer $$$n=6$$$, $$$n$$$ will be changed to $$$8$$$.</p><p>Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.</p><p>Now, for two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, Orac asked you to add $$$f(n)$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times (note that $$$n$$$ will change after each operation, so $$$f(n)$$$ may change too) and tell him the final value of $$$n$$$.</p><p>For example, if Orac gives you $$$n=5$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, at first you should add $$$f(5)=5$$$ to $$$n=5$$$, so your new value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$n=10$$$, after that, you should add $$$f(10)=2$$$ to $$$10$$$, so your new (and the final!) value of $$$n$$$ will be equal to $$$12$$$.</p><p>Orac may ask you these queries many times.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input is a single integer $$$t\\ (1\\le t\\le 100)$$$: the number of times that Orac will ask you.</p><p>Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains two positive integers $$$n,k\\ (2\\le n\\le 10^6, 1\\le k\\le 10^9)$$$, corresponding to a query by Orac.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ is at most $$$10^6$$$. </p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$t$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the final value of $$$n$$$ in the $$$i$$$-th query by Orac.</p>",

    ],
    "note": "<p>In the first query, $$$n=5$$$ and $$$k=1$$$. The divisors of $$$5$$$ are $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$, the smallest one except $$$1$$$ is $$$5$$$. Therefore, the only operation adds $$$f(5)=5$$$ to $$$5$$$, and the result is $$$10$$$.</p><p>In the second query, $$$n=8$$$ and $$$k=2$$$. The divisors of $$$8$$$ are $$$1,2,4,8$$$, where the smallest one except $$$1$$$ is $$$2$$$, then after one operation $$$8$$$ turns into $$$8+(f(8)=2)=10$$$. The divisors of $$$10$$$ are $$$1,2,5,10$$$, where the smallest one except $$$1$$$ is $$$2$$$, therefore the answer is $$$10+(f(10)=2)=12$$$.</p><p>In the third query, $$$n$$$ is changed as follows: $$$3 \\to 6 \\to 8 \\to 10 \\to 12$$$.</p>",
