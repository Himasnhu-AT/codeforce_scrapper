Vasya immediately went to the store and bought <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> colored sheets of paper, the area of each sheet is 1 square meter.</p><p>The garland must consist of exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> pieces of colored paper of arbitrary area, each piece should be of a certain color. To make the garland, Vasya can arbitrarily cut his existing colored sheets into pieces. Vasya is not obliged to use all the sheets to make the garland.</p><p>Vasya wants the garland to be as attractive as possible, so he wants to maximize the total area of \u200b\u200b<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> pieces of paper in the garland. Calculate what the maximum total area of \u200b\u200bthe pieces of paper in the garland Vasya can get.</p>",
