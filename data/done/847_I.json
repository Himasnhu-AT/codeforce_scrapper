    "statement": "<p>The Berland's capital has the form of a rectangle with sizes <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> quarters. All quarters are divided into three types:</p><ul> <li> regular (labeled with the character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span>') \u2014 such quarters do not produce the noise but are not obstacles to the propagation of the noise; </li><li> sources of noise (labeled with an uppercase Latin letter from '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>' to '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Z</span>') \u2014 such quarters are noise sources and are not obstacles to the propagation of the noise; </li><li> heavily built-up (labeled with the character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*</span>') \u2014 such quarters are soundproofed, the noise does not penetrate into them and they themselves are obstacles to the propagation of noise. </li></ul><p>A quarter labeled with letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>' produces <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i></span> units of noise. A quarter labeled with letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>' produces <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u00b7<i>q</i></span> units of noise. And so on, up to a quarter labeled with letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Z</span>', which produces <span class=\"tex-span\">26\u00b7<i>q</i></span> units of noise. There can be any number of quarters labeled with each letter in the city.</p><p>When propagating from the source of the noise, the noise level is halved when moving from one quarter to a quarter that shares a side with it (when an odd number is to be halved, it's rounded down). The noise spreads along the chain. For example, if some quarter is located at a distance <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> from the noise source, then the value of noise which will reach the quarter is divided by <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>. So the noise level that comes from the source to the quarter is determined solely by the length of the shortest path between them. Heavily built-up quarters are obstacles, the noise does not penetrate into them.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/aa1e11429c2d5d9a5894cd3bf419db4990c35d75.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The values in the cells of the table on the right show the total noise level in the respective quarters for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i>\u2009=\u2009100</span>, the first term in each sum is the noise from the quarter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>', the second \u2014 the noise from the quarter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>'.</span> </center><p>The noise level in quarter is defined as the sum of the noise from all sources.
