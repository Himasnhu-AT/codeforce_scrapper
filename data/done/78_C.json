    "statement": "<p>Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.</p><p>There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> logs, each of exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> meters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">equal</span> parts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> meters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.</p><p>Timur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains three integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>,\u2009<i>m</i>,\u2009<i>k</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>).</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Timur</span>\", if Timur wins, or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Marsel</span>\", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes. </p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first sample the beavers only have one log, of <span class=\"tex-span\">15</span> meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> parts each <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009=\u20094</span>. Thus, the winner is Timur.</p><p>In the second example the beavers have <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> logs <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span> meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> meters, that's why he loses instantly.</p>",
