To cope with this, ICPC Jakarta is planning to build <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">two</span> new buildings. These buildings should have a shape of a rectangle of the same size. Now, their problem is to find land to build the buildings.</p><p>There are $$$N$$$ lands available for sale. The $$$i^{th}$$$ land has a rectangular shape of size $$$L_i \\times W_i$$$. For a good feng shui, the building's side should be parallel to the land's sides.</p><p>One way is to build the two buildings on two different lands, one on each land (not necessarily with the same orientation). A building of size $$$A \\times B$$$ can be build on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land if and only if at least one of the following is satisfied: </p><ul> <li> $$$A \\le L_i$$$ and $$$B \\le W_i$$$, or </li><li> $$$A \\le W_i$$$ and $$$B \\le L_i$$$. </li></ul> Alternatively, it is also possible to build two buildings of $$$A \\times B$$$ on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land with the same orientation. Formally, it is possible to build two buildings of $$$A \\times B$$$ on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land if and only if at least one of the following is satisfied: <ul> <li> $$$A \\times 2 \\le L_i$$$ and $$$B \\le W_i$$$, or </li><li> $$$A \\times 2 \\le W_i$$$ and $$$B \\le L_i$$$, or </li><li> $$$A \\le L_i$$$ and $$$B \\times 2 \\le W_i$$$, or </li><li> $$$A \\le W_i$$$ and $$$B \\times 2 \\le L_i$$$. </li></ul><p>Your task in this problem is to help ICPC Jakarta to figure out the largest possible buildings they can build given $$$N$$$ available lands.
