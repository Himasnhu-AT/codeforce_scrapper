    "statement": "<p>Santa has $$$n$$$ candies and he wants to gift them to $$$k$$$ kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all $$$k$$$ kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.</p><p>Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has $$$a$$$ candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has $$$b$$$ candies. Then Santa will be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">satisfied</span>, if the both conditions are met at the same time:</p><ul> <li> $$$b - a \\le 1$$$ (it means $$$b = a$$$ or $$$b = a + 1$$$); </li><li> the number of kids who has $$$a+1$$$ candies (<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">note that $$$a+1$$$ not necessarily equals $$$b$$$</span>) does not exceed $$$\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\rfloor$$$ (less than or equal to $$$\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\rfloor$$$). </li></ul><p>$$$\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\rfloor$$$ is $$$k$$$ divided by $$$2$$$ and rounded <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">down</span> to the nearest integer. For example, if $$$k=5$$$ then $$$\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\rfloor=\\lfloor\\frac{5}{2}\\rfloor=2$$$.</p><p>Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">satisfied</span>.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",

The answer cannot be greater because then the number of kids with $$$5$$$ candies will be $$$3$$$.</p><p>In the third test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way: $$$[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]$$$. There $$$a=1,b=2,a+1=2$$$. He cannot distribute two remaining candies in a way to be satisfied.</p><p>In the fourth test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way: $$$[3, 3]$$$. There $$$a=3, b=3, a+1=4$$$. Santa distributed all $$$6$$$ candies.</p>",
