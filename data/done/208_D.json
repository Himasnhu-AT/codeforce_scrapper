    "statement": "<p>Vasya, like many others, likes to participate in a variety of sweepstakes and lotteries. Now he collects wrappings from a famous chocolate bar \"Jupiter\". According to the sweepstake rules, each wrapping has an integer written on it \u2014 the number of points that the participant adds to his score as he buys the bar. After a participant earns a certain number of points, he can come to the prize distribution center and exchange the points for prizes. When somebody takes a prize, the prize's cost is simply subtracted from the number of his points.</p><p>Vasya didn't only bought the bars, he also kept a record of how many points each wrapping cost. Also, he remembers that he always stucks to the greedy strategy \u2014 as soon as he could take at least one prize, he went to the prize distribution centre and exchanged the points for prizes. Moreover, if he could choose between multiple prizes, he chose the most expensive one. If after an exchange Vasya had enough points left to get at least one more prize, then he continued to exchange points.</p><p>The sweepstake has the following prizes (the prizes are sorted by increasing of their cost): </p><ul> <li> a mug (costs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> points), </li><li> a towel (costs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> points), </li><li> a bag (costs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span> points), </li><li> a bicycle (costs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> points), </li><li> a car (costs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>e</i></span> points). </li></ul><p>Now Vasya wants to recollect what prizes he has received.
