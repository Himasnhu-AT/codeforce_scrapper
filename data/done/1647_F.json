For example, for an array $$$[69, 1000, 228, -7]$$$ the array $$$[1000, -7]$$$ is a subsequence, while $$$[1]$$$ and $$$[-7, 1000]$$$ are not.</p><p>Splitting an array into two subsequences is called good if each element belongs to exactly one subsequence, and also each of these subsequences is a hill.</p><p>You are given an array of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$. It is required to find the number of different pairs of maxima of the first and second subsequences among all good splits. Two pairs that only differ in the order of elements are considered same.</p>",

It is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are pairwise distinct.</p>",
