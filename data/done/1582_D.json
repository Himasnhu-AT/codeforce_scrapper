As a result, he got an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.</p><p>Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number $$$0$$$ and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\cdot b_i=0$$$. Since Vupsen doesn't like number $$$0$$$, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the array $$$b$$$ must not contain numbers equal to $$$0$$$</span>. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the sum of their absolute values cannot exceed $$$10^9$$$</span>. Please help Vupsen to find any such array $$$b$$$!</p>",
