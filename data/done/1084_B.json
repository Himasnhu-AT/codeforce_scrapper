You can pour your glass by <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$1$$$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $$$s$$$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.</p><p>Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $$$s$$$ liters of kvass.</p>",
