Natasha also knows that this store works according to the following schedule: 2 months in a year were selected: $$$x_l$$$ and $$$x_r$$$ ($$$1\\le x_l\\le x_r\\le x_{max}$$$), 2 days in a month: $$$y_l$$$ and $$$y_r$$$ ($$$1\\le y_l\\le y_r\\le y_{max}$$$) and 2 seconds in a day: $$$z_l$$$ and $$$z_r$$$ ($$$1\\le z_l\\le z_r\\le z_{max}$$$). The store works at all such moments (month $$$x$$$, day $$$y$$$, second $$$z$$$), when simultaneously $$$x_l\\le x\\le x_r$$$, $$$y_l\\le y\\le y_r$$$ and $$$z_l\\le z\\le z_r$$$.</p><p>Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the numbers $$$x_l,x_r,y_l,y_r,z_l,z_r$$$.</p><p>One Martian told Natasha: \"I went to this store $$$(n+m)$$$ times. $$$n$$$ times of them it was opened, and $$$m$$$ times\u00a0\u2014 closed.\" He also described his every trip to the store: the month, day, second of the trip and whether the store was open or closed at that moment.</p><p>Natasha can go to the store $$$k$$$ times.
