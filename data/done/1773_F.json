    "statement": "<p>Scientists are researching an impact of football match results on the mood of football fans. They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the number of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future.</p><p>In football, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A score \"$$$x$$$<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">:</span>$$$y$$$\" means that the team we observe scored $$$x$$$ goals and conceded $$$y$$$ goals. If $$$x = y$$$, then the match ends in a draw. If $$$x &gt; y$$$, then the observed team wins, and if $$$x &lt; y$$$, then it loses.</p><p>To find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team ($$$n$$$), the number of goals scored in these matches ($$$a$$$), and the number of goals conceded in these matches ($$$b$$$). </p><p>You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.</p>",
