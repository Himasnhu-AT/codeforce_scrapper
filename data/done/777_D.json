    "statement": "<p>Vasya is an administrator of a public page of organization \"Mouse and keyboard\" and his everyday duty is to publish news from the world of competitive programming. For each news he also creates a list of hashtags to make searching for a particular topic more comfortable. For the purpose of this problem we define hashtag as a string consisting of lowercase English letters and exactly one symbol '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">#</span>' located at the beginning of the string. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">length</span> of the hashtag is defined as the number of symbols in it <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">without</span> the symbol '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">#</span>'.</p><p>The head administrator of the page told Vasya that hashtags should go in lexicographical order (take a look at the notes section for the definition).</p><p>Vasya is lazy so he doesn't want to actually change the order of hashtags in already published news. Instead, he decided to delete some suffixes (consecutive characters at the end of the string) of some of the hashtags. He is allowed to delete any number of characters, even the whole string except for the symbol '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">#</span>'. Vasya wants to pick such a way to delete suffixes that the total number of deleted symbols is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> possible. If there are several optimal solutions, he is fine with any of them.</p>",
