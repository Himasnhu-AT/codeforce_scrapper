    "statement": "<p>You are given three strings $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ of the same length $$$n$$$. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$a$$$ is $$$a_i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$b$$$ is $$$b_i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th letter of $$$c$$$ is $$$c_i$$$.</p><p>For every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$) you <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">must</span> swap (i.e. exchange) $$$c_i$$$ with either $$$a_i$$$ or $$$b_i$$$. So in total you'll perform exactly $$$n$$$ swap operations, each of them either $$$c_i \\leftrightarrow a_i$$$ or $$$c_i \\leftrightarrow b_i$$$ ($$$i$$$ iterates over all integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive).</p><p>For example, if $$$a$$$ is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">code</span>\", $$$b$$$ is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">true</span>\", and $$$c$$$ is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">help</span>\", you can make $$$c$$$ equal to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">crue</span>\" taking the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$4$$$-th letters from $$$a$$$ and the others from $$$b$$$. In this way $$$a$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hodp</span>\" and $$$b$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">tele</span>\".</p><p>Is it possible that after these swaps the string $$$a$$$ becomes exactly the same as the string $$$b$$$?</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 100$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$b$$$.</p><p>The third line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters $$$c$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-empty and have the same length, which is not exceeding $$$100$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$t$$$ lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case:</p><p>If it is possible to make string $$$a$$$ equal to string $$$b$$$ print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" (without quotes).</p><p>You can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string $$$a$$$ becomes exactly the same as string $$$b$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, you should swap $$$c_i$$$ with $$$a_i$$$ for all possible $$$i$$$. After the swaps $$$a$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bca</span>\", $$$b$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bca</span>\" and $$$c$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>\". Here the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal.</p><p>In the third test case, you should swap $$$c_1$$$ with $$$a_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$ with $$$b_2$$$, $$$c_3$$$ with $$$b_3$$$ and $$$c_4$$$ with $$$a_4$$$. Then string $$$a$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">baba</span>\", string $$$b$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">baba</span>\" and string $$$c$$$ becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abab</span>\".
