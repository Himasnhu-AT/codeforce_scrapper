    "statement": "<p>Long is a huge fan of CFC (Codeforces Fried Chicken). But the price of CFC is increasing, so he decides to breed the chicken on his own farm.</p><p>His farm is presented by a rectangle grid with $$$r$$$ rows and $$$c$$$ columns. Some of these cells contain rice, others are empty. $$$k$$$ chickens are living on his farm. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">The number of chickens is not greater than the number of cells with rice on the farm.</span></p><p>Long wants to give his chicken playgrounds by assigning these farm cells to his chickens. He would like to satisfy the following requirements:</p><ul> <li> Each cell of the farm is assigned to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> chicken. </li><li> Each chicken is assigned <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least one</span> cell. </li><li> The set of cells assigned to every chicken forms a connected area. More precisely, if two cells $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(u, v)$$$ are assigned to the same chicken, this chicken is able to walk from $$$(x, y)$$$ to $$$(u, v)$$$ by passing only its cells and moving from each cell to another cell sharing a side. </li></ul><p>Long also wants to prevent his chickens from fighting for food. Hence he wants the difference between the maximum and the minimum number of cells with rice assigned to a chicken to be as small as possible. Please help him.</p>",

Two characters should be equal if and only if the two corresponding cells are assigned to the same chicken. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Uppercase and lowercase characters are considered different, so \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\" belong to two different chickens.</span></p><p>If there are multiple optimal answers, print any.</p>",
