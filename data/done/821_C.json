    "statement": "<p>Okabe and Super Hacker Daru are stacking and removing boxes. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> boxes numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Initially there are no boxes on the stack.</p><p>Okabe, being a control freak, gives Daru <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>n</i></span> commands: <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> of which are to add a box to the top of the stack, and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> of which are to remove a box from the top of the stack and throw it in the trash. Okabe wants Daru to throw away the boxes in the order from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Of course, this means that it might be impossible for Daru to perform some of Okabe's <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">remove</span> commands, because the required box is not on the top of the stack.</p><p>That's why Daru can decide to wait until Okabe looks away and then reorder the boxes in the stack in any way he wants. He can do it at any point of time between Okabe's commands, but he can't add or remove boxes while he does it.</p><p>Tell Daru the minimum number of times he needs to reorder the boxes so that he can successfully complete all of Okabe's commands. It is guaranteed that every box is added before it is required to be removed.</p>",
