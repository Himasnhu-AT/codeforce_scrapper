She lives in the city number $$$1$$$. </p><p>There is a direct train <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">route</span> between each pair of distinct cities $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, where $$$i \\neq j$$$. In total there are $$$n(n-1)$$$ distinct routes. Every route has a cost, cost for route from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ may be different from the cost of route from $$$j$$$ to $$$i$$$.</p><p>Masha wants to start her journey in city $$$1$$$, take <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$ routes from one city to another and as a result return to the city $$$1$$$. Masha is really careful with money, so she wants the journey to be as cheap as possible. To do so Masha doesn't mind visiting a city multiple times or even taking the same route multiple times.</p><p>Masha doesn't want her journey to have odd cycles. Formally, if you can select visited by Masha city $$$v$$$, take <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> number of routes used by Masha in her journey and return to the city $$$v$$$, such journey is considered unsuccessful.</p><p>Help Masha to find the cheapest (with minimal total cost of all taken routes) successful journey.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>First line of input had two integer numbers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 80; 2 \\leq k \\leq 10$$$): number of cities in the country and number of routes in Masha's journey. It is guaranteed that $$$k$$$ is even.</p><p>Next $$$n$$$ lines hold route descriptions: $$$j$$$-th number in $$$i$$$-th line represents the cost of route from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ if $$$i \\neq j$$$, and is 0 otherwise (there are no routes $$$i \\to i$$$). All route costs are integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^8$$$.</p>",
