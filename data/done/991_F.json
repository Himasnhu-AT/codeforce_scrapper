    "statement": "<p>Vasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important\u00a0\u2014 factorization of a number less than <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000000</span> is easier than of a number less than <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000000000</span>. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000000</span> you could write $$$10^{6}$$$, instead of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000000000</span> \u00a0\u2014$$$10^{9}$$$, instead of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000000007</span>\u00a0\u2014 $$$10^{9}+7$$$.</p><p>Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules: </p><ul> <li> the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>\"), multiplication (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*</span>\") and exponentiation (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">^</span>\"), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden; </li><li> the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">2^3^4</span>\" is unacceptable; </li><li> the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number; </li><li> the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols. </li></ul><p>Given $$$n$$$, find the equivalent concise notation for it.</p>",
