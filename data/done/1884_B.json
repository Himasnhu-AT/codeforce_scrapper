    "note": "<p>In the first test case, we cannot swap any elements, and the number $$$1$$$ is not divisible by $$$2$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, the initial number is $$$1$$$. It is not divisible by $$$2$$$, but if we perform the operation, then we obtain the number with binary representation $$$10$$$, which is equal to $$$2$$$ in decimal representation, thus, it is divisible by $$$2$$$. But this number is not divisible by $$$4$$$ and we cannot obtain any other number using the operations.</p><p>In the third test case, the initial number is $$$2$$$. For $$$i = 1$$$ we do not have to perform any operations since the initial number is divisible by $$$2$$$. For $$$i = 2$$$ we can perform one operation swapping the first two bits (we would obtain $$$100$$$ in binary representation, which corresponds to number $$$4$$$).
