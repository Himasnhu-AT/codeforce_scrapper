    "statement": "<p>For the first time, Polycarp's startup ended the year with a profit! Now he is about to distribute $$$k$$$ burles as a bonus among $$$n$$$ employees.</p><p>It is known that the current salary of the $$$i$$$-th employee is $$$a_i$$$ and all the values of $$$a_i$$$ in the company are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span>.</p><p>Polycarp wants to distribute the $$$k$$$ burles between $$$n$$$ employees so this month the $$$i$$$-th employee will be paid not $$$a_i$$$, but $$$a_i+d_i$$$ ($$$d_i \\ge 0$$$, $$$d_i$$$ is an integer), where $$$d_i$$$ is the bonus for the $$$i$$$-th employee. Of course, $$$d_1+d_2+\\dots+d_n=k$$$.</p><p>Polycarp will follow two rules for choosing the values $$$d_i$$$:</p><ul> <li> the relative order of the salaries should not be changed: the employee with originally the highest salary ($$$a_i$$$ is the maximum) should have the highest total payment after receiving their bonus ($$$a_i+d_i$$$ is also the maximum), the employee whose salary was originally the second-largest should receive the second-largest total payment after receiving their bonus and so on. </li><li> to emphasize that annual profit is a group effort, Polycarp wants to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimize</span> the maximum total payment to an employee (i.e minimize the maximum value of $$$a_i+d_i$$$). </li></ul><p>Help Polycarp decide the non-negative integer bonuses $$$d_i$$$ such that:</p><ul> <li> their sum is $$$k$$$, </li><li> for each employee, the number of those who receive <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly more</span> than them remains unchanged (that is, if you sort employees by $$$a_i$$$ and by $$$a_i+d_i$$$, you get the same order of employees), </li><li> all $$$a_i + d_i$$$ are different, </li><li> the maximum of the values $$$a_i+d_i$$$ is the minimum possible. </li></ul><p>Help Polycarp and print any of the possible answers $$$d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n$$$.</p>",
