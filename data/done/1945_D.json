    "statement": "<p>The guys lined up in a queue of $$$n$$$ people, starting with person number $$$i = 1$$$, to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later and stood at the end of the line after the $$$n$$$-th person. Kirill is completely dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of him.</p><p>For the $$$i$$$-th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. If at the moment Kirill is standing at position $$$i$$$, then he can choose any position $$$j$$$ such that $$$j &lt; i$$$ and exchange places with the person at position $$$j$$$. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him $$$a_j$$$ coins. And for each $$$k$$$ such that $$$j &lt; k &lt; i$$$, Kirill will have to pay $$$b_k$$$ coins to the person at position $$$k$$$. Kirill can perform this action any number of times.</p><p>Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first $$$m$$$ people in line.</p><p>Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in order to not wait too long.</p>",

Then follows the description of the test case.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le m \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ separated by spaces ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).</p><p>The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ separated by spaces ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
