He will have to choose another shelf, but which one should he choose, how large should it be?</p><p>In order to get to know this, the Hedgehog asks you to write him a program that will count the estimated number of presents that he will receive during the following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> days. Besides, he is guided by the principle: </p><ul> <li> on each holiday day the Hedgehog will necessarily receive a present, </li><li> he receives presents at least every <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>K</i></span> days (i.e., if he received a present on the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day, he will receive the next present no later than on the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i>\u2009+\u2009<i>K</i></span>-th day). </li></ul> <p>For the given <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>K</i></span>, as well as the list of holidays among the following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> days count the minimal number of presents that could be given to the Hedgehog.
