You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>Little Dormi has recently received a puzzle from his friend and needs your help to solve it. </p><p>The puzzle consists of an upright board with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns of cells, some empty and some filled with blocks of sand, and $$$m$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$). In this version of the problem, $$$a_i$$$ will be <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">equal to</span> the number of blocks of sand in column $$$i$$$.</p><p>When a cell filled with a block of sand is disturbed, the block of sand will fall from its cell to the sand counter at the bottom of the column (each column has a sand counter). While a block of sand is falling, other blocks of sand that are adjacent at any point to the falling block of sand will also be disturbed and start to fall. Specifically, a block of sand disturbed at a cell $$$(i,j)$$$ will pass through all cells below and including the cell $$$(i,j)$$$ within the column, disturbing all adjacent cells along the way. Here, the cells adjacent to a cell $$$(i,j)$$$ are defined as $$$(i-1,j)$$$, $$$(i,j-1)$$$, $$$(i+1,j)$$$, and $$$(i,j+1)$$$ (if they are within the grid). Note that the newly falling blocks can disturb other blocks.</p><p>In one operation you are able to disturb any piece of sand. The puzzle is solved when there are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least</span> $$$a_i$$$ blocks of sand counted in the $$$i$$$-th sand counter for each column from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.</p><p>You are now tasked with finding the minimum amount of operations in order to solve the puzzle. Note that Little Dormi will never give you a puzzle that is impossible to solve.</p>",
