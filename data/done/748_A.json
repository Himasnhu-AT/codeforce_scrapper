The lanes are numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> from the left to the right, the desks in a lane are numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> starting from the blackboard. Note that the lanes go perpendicularly to the blackboard, not along it (see picture).</p><p>The organizers numbered all the working places from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>nm</i></span>. The places are numbered by lanes (i.\u00a0e. all the places of the first lane go first, then all the places of the second lane, and so on), in a lane the places are numbered starting from the nearest to the blackboard (i.\u00a0e. from the first desk in the lane), at each desk, the place on the left is numbered before the place on the right.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"170px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/6af84fa977bacba86e6438bd85fcc99bf2b16068.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"378px\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The picture illustrates the first and the second samples.</span> </center><p>Santa Clause knows that his place has number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>.
