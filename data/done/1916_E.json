And since they are very responsible guys, they have started preparing for admission already.</p><p>First of all, they decided to take care of where they will live for the long four years of study, and after visiting the university's website, they found out that the university dormitory can be represented as a root tree with $$$n$$$ vertices with the root at vertex $$$1$$$. In the tree, each vertex represents a recreation with some type of activity $$$a_i$$$. The friends need to choose $$$2$$$ recreations (not necessarily different) in which they will settle. The guys are convinced that the more the value of the following function $$$f(u, v) = diff(u, lca(u, v)) \\cdot diff(v, lca(u, v))$$$, the more fun their life will be.

The same colors mean that the activities in the recreations match. Consider the pair of vertices $$$(11, 12)$$$, $$$lca(11, 12) = 1$$$. Write down all activities on the path from $$$11$$$ to $$$1$$$\u00a0\u2014 $$$[11, 5, 1, 11]$$$, among them there are $$$3$$$ different activities, so $$$diff(11, 1) = 3$$$. Also write down all activities on the path from $$$12$$$ to $$$1$$$\u00a0\u2014 $$$[7, 8, 2, 11]$$$, among them there are $$$4$$$ different activities, so $$$diff(12, 1) = 4$$$. We get that $$$f(11, 12) = diff(12, 1) \\cdot diff(11, 1) = 4 \\cdot 3 = 12$$$, which is the answer for this tree. It can be shown that a better answer is impossible to obtain.",
