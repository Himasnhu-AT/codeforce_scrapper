There is a rule in arrays pawnshop: you can sell array only if it can be compressed to a generator.</p><p>This generator takes four non-negative numbers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$s$$$. $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ must be positive, $$$s$$$ non-negative and for $$$c$$$ it must be true that $$$0 \\leq c &lt; m$$$. The array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is created according to the following rules: </p><ul> <li> $$$a_1 = s \\bmod m$$$, here $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes remainder of the division of $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$; </li><li> $$$a_i = (a_{i-1} + c) \\bmod m$$$ for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 &lt; i \\le n$$$. </li></ul><p>For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, $$$m = 7$$$, $$$c = 4$$$, and $$$s = 10$$$, then $$$a = [3, 0, 4, 1, 5]$$$.</p><p>Price of such an array is the value of $$$m$$$ in this generator.</p><p>Alex has a question: how much money he can get for each of the arrays. Please, help him to understand for every array whether there exist four numbers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$s$$$ that generate this array. If yes, then maximize $$$m$$$.</p>",
