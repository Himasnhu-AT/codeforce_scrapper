The vertices of the cake are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of those vertices to cut <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-intersecting</span> diagonals into the cake. In other words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.</p><p>Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in the cake, but those will not be counted). </p><p>Bessie has already chosen $$$x$$$ of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals. She wants you to choose <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">no more than</span> $$$y$$$ other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.</p><p>What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?</p>",
