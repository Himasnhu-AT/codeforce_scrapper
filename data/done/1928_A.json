    "statement": "<p>Bob has a rectangle of size $$$a \\times b$$$. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">other</span> rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.</p><p>Note that if two rectangles differ only by a $$$90^{\\circ}$$$ rotation, they are considered <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the same</span>. For example, the rectangles $$$6 \\times 4$$$ and $$$4 \\times 6$$$ are considered the same.</p><p>Thus, from the $$$2 \\times 6$$$ rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because it can be cut into two $$$2 \\times 3$$$ rectangles, and then these two rectangles can be used to form the $$$4 \\times 3$$$ rectangle, which is different from the $$$2 \\times 6$$$ rectangle.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/670958570876245598e151e6877e3b0231a7c60e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>However, from the $$$2 \\times 1$$$ rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed, because it can only be cut into two rectangles of $$$1 \\times 1$$$, and from these, only the $$$1 \\times 2$$$ and $$$2 \\times 1$$$ rectangles can be formed, which are considered the same.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1463aaa4fa7eb1e7432c1d8b5813e7ae91147066.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.</p><p>The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the size of Bob's rectangle.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Yes</span>\" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the $$$a \\times b$$$ rectangle. Otherwise, output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">No</span>\".</p><p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yEs</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yes</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Yes</span>\", and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" will be recognized as positive answers.</p>",
