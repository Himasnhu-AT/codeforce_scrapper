Markland-N, Rin received an artifact, given to her by the exploration captain Sagar.</p><p>After much analysis, she now realizes that this artifact contains data about a strange flower, which has existed way before the New Age. However, the information about its chemical structure has been encrypted heavily.</p><p>The chemical structure of this flower can be represented as a string $$$p$$$. From the unencrypted papers included, Rin already knows the length $$$n$$$ of that string, and she can also conclude that the string contains at most three distinct letters: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>\" (as in Carbon), \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">H</span>\" (as in Hydrogen), and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">O</span>\" (as in Oxygen).</p><p>At each moment, Rin can input a string $$$s$$$ of an arbitrary length into the artifact's terminal, and it will return every starting position of $$$s$$$ as a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">substring</span> of $$$p$$$.</p><p>However, the artifact has limited energy and cannot be recharged in any way, since the technology is way too ancient and is incompatible with any current A.R.C.'s devices. To be specific:</p><ul> <li> The artifact only contains $$$\\frac{7}{5}$$$ units of energy. </li><li> For each time Rin inputs a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$t$$$, the artifact consumes $$$\\frac{1}{t^2}$$$ units of energy. </li><li> If the amount of energy reaches below zero, the task will be considered failed immediately, as the artifact will go black forever. </li></ul><p>Since the artifact is so precious yet fragile, Rin is very nervous to attempt to crack the final data. Can you give her a helping hand?</p>",
