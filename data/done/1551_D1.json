The value of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ is even.</p><p>A domino is a figure that consists of two cells having a common side. It may be horizontal (one of the cells is to the right of the other) or vertical (one of the cells is above the other).</p><p>You need to find out whether it is possible to place $$$\\frac{nm}{2}$$$ dominoes on the table so that exactly $$$k$$$ of them are horizontal and all the other dominoes are vertical. The dominoes cannot overlap and must fill the whole table.</p>",
