In one second she can choose arbitrary position in any word and replace its character with some uppercase Latin letter. Ksenia can't remove or add letters in any of the words.</p><p>What is the minimal number of seconds Ksenia is required to spend to change the last year list to the current one?</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">The lists are unordered</span>.
