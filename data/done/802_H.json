    "statement": "<p>Thanks to your help, Heidi is confident that no one can fool her. She has now decided to post some fake news on the HC<span class=\"tex-span\"><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup></span> Facebook page. However, she wants to be able to communicate to the HC<span class=\"tex-span\"><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup></span> committee that the post is fake, using some secret phrase hidden in the post as a subsequence. To make this method foolproof, she wants the phrase to appear <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> times in the post. She is asking you to design a post (string) <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and a hidden phrase <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> such that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> appears in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> as a subsequence exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> times.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first and only line of input contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u20091\u2009000\u2009000</span>).</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>The output should contain two nonempty strings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> separated by a single space. Each string should be composed of letters (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>-<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>-<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Z</span>: both lowercase and uppercase are allowed) and have length at most <span class=\"tex-span\">200</span>. The number of occurrences of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> as a subsequence should be exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. If there are many possible solutions, output any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.</p>",

    "note": "<p>An occurrence of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> as a subsequence in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> should be thought of as a set of positions in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> such that the letters at these positions, in order, form <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span>. The number of occurences is thus the number of such sets. For example, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ab</span> appears 6 times as a subsequence in <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aaabb</span>, for the following sets of positions: <span class=\"tex-span\">{1,\u20094},\u2009{1,\u20095},\u2009{2,\u20094},\u2009{2,\u20095},\u2009{3,\u20094},\u2009{3,\u20095}</span> (that is, we should choose one of the <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>'s and one of the <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>'s).</p>",
