During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is the correct formal description of the homework assignment:</p><p>You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ only consisting of characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\". There are $$$q$$$ queries of format ($$$pos, c$$$), meaning replacing the element of string $$$s$$$ at position $$$pos$$$ with character $$$c$$$. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>\" as a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">substring</span>. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\".</p><p>A string $$$x$$$ is a substring of a string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \\le n, q \\le 10^5)$$$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\".</p><p>Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains an integer $$$i$$$ and character $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $$$c$$$ value is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>\".</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>\" as a substring.</p>",
