    "statement": "<p>Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked $$$n$$$ of them how much effort they needed to reach red.</p><p>\"Oh, I just spent $$$x_i$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">hours</span> solving problems\", said the $$$i$$$-th of them. </p><p>Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minutes</span> ($$$60 \\cdot x_i$$$), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes \u2014 for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent $$$2$$$ hours, Bob could write $$$000120$$$ instead of $$$120$$$.</p><p>Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently: </p><ul> <li> rearranged its digits, or </li><li> wrote a random number. </li></ul><p>This way, Alice generated $$$n$$$ numbers, denoted $$$y_1$$$, ..., $$$y_n$$$.</p><p>For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $$$y_i$$$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $$$60$$$ (possibly with leading zeroes).</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 418$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of grandmasters Bob asked.</p><p>Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which contains a single integer $$$y_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number that Alice wrote down.</p><p>Each of these numbers has between $$$2$$$ and $$$100$$$ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output $$$n$$$ lines.</p><p>For each $$$i$$$, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $$$y_i$$$ such that the resulting number is divisible by $$$60$$$, output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">red</span>\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cyan</span>\".</p>",

None of these numbers is divisible by $$$60$$$.</p><p>In the fourth example, there are $$$3$$$ rearrangements: $$$228$$$, $$$282$$$, $$$822$$$.</p><p>In the fifth example, none of the $$$24$$$ rearrangements result in a number divisible by $$$60$$$.</p><p>In the sixth example, note that $$$000\\dots0$$$ is a valid solution.</p>",
