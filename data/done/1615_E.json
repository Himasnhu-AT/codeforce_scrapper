    "statement": "<p>Two players, Red and Blue, are at it again, and this time they're playing with crayons! The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.</p><p>The game works as follows: there is a tree of size $$$n$$$, rooted at node $$$1$$$, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one turn each</span>. Red goes first. </p><p>In Red's turn, he can do the following operation <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any number of times</span>: </p><ul> <li> Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. </li></ul> However, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color $$$k$$$ nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most $$$k$$$ of the nodes can be colored red.<p>Then, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any number of times</span>: </p><ul> <li> Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. </li></ul> Note: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.<p>After the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let $$$w$$$ be the number of white nodes, $$$r$$$ be the number of red nodes, and $$$b$$$ be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is $$$w \\cdot (r - b)$$$.</p><p>Red wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it. If both players play optimally, what will the final score of the game be?</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum number of red nodes.</p><p>Next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains description of edges. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two space separated integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n$$$; $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the $$$i$$$-th edge of the tree.</p><p>It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree.</p>",
