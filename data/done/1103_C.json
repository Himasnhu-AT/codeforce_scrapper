    "statement": "<p>Today is tuesday, that means there is a dispute in JOHNNY SOLVING team again: they try to understand who is Johnny and who is Solving. That's why guys asked Umnik to help them. Umnik gave guys a connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices without loops and multiedges, such that a degree of any vertex is at least $$$3$$$, and also he gave a number $$$1 \\leq k \\leq n$$$. Because Johnny is not too smart, he promised to find a simple path with length at least $$$\\frac{n}{k}$$$ in the graph. In reply, Solving promised to find $$$k$$$ simple by vertices cycles with representatives, such that: </p><ul> <li> Length of each cycle is at least $$$3$$$. </li><li> Length of each cycle is not divisible by $$$3$$$. </li><li> In each cycle must be a representative - vertex, which belongs only to this cycle among all <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">printed</span> cycles. </li></ul><p>You need to help guys resolve the dispute, for that you need to find a solution for Johnny: a simple path with length at least $$$\\frac{n}{k}$$$ ($$$n$$$ is not necessarily divided by $$$k$$$), or solution for Solving: $$$k$$$ cycles that satisfy all the conditions above. If there is no any solution - print $$$-1$$$. </p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 2.5 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$)</p><p>Next $$$m$$$ lines describe edges of the graph in format $$$v$$$, $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\leq v, u \\leq n$$$). It's guaranteed that $$$v \\neq u$$$ and all $$$m$$$ pairs are distinct.</p><p>It's guaranteed that a degree of each vertex is at least $$$3$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print PATH in the first line, if you solve problem for Johnny. In the second line print the number of vertices in the path $$$c$$$ ($$$c \\geq \\frac{n}{k}$$$). And in the third line print vertices describing the path in route order.</p><p>Print CYCLES in the first line, if you solve problem for Solving. In the following lines describe <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$ cycles in the following format: in the first line print the size of the cycle $$$c$$$ ($$$c \\geq 3$$$). In the second line print the cycle in route order. Also, the first vertex in the cycle must be a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">representative</span>.</p><p>Print $$$-1$$$ if there is no any solution. The total amount of printed numbers in the output must be at most $$$10^6$$$. It's guaranteed, that if exists any solution then there is a correct output satisfies this restriction.</p>",
