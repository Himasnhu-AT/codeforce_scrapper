Koa and her best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to $$$0$$$. Koa starts.</p><p>Let's describe a move in the game:</p><ul> <li> During his move, a player chooses any element of the array and removes it from this array, xor-ing it with the current score of the player.<p> More formally: if the current score of the player is $$$x$$$ and the chosen element is $$$y$$$, his new score will be $$$x \\oplus y$$$. Here $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR operation</a>.</p><p> Note that after a move element $$$y$$$ is removed from $$$a$$$.</p><p> </p></li><li> The game ends when the array is empty. </li></ul><p>At the end of the game the winner is the player with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a draw.</p><p>If both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or draw the game.</p>",
