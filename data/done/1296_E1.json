Note that the constraints and the output format are different</span>.</p><p>You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters.</p><p>You have to color <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> its characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one of the two colors</span> (each character to exactly one color, the same letters can be colored the same or different colors, i.e. you can choose exactly one color for each index in $$$s$$$).</p><p>After coloring, you can swap <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> two neighboring characters of the string that are colored <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> colors. You can perform such an operation arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.</p><p>The goal is to make the string sorted, i.e. all characters should be in alphabetical order.</p><p>Your task is to say if it is possible to color the given string so that after coloring it can become sorted by <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">some</span> sequence of swaps. Note that you have to restore only coloring, not the sequence of swaps.</p>",
