    "statement": "<p>Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$$$.</p><p>In this game, initially $$$n$$$ players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:</p><ul> <li> Nene finds the $$$a_1$$$-th, $$$a_2$$$-th, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_k$$$-th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the $$$i$$$-th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than $$$i$$$ players in a row, they are skipped. </li></ul><p>Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners.</p><p>For example, consider the game with $$$a=[3, 5]$$$ and $$$n=5$$$ players. Let the players be named player <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>, player <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>, $$$\\ldots$$$, player <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">E</span> in the order they are lined up initially. Then, </p><ul> <li> Before the first round, players are lined up as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ABCDE</span>. Nene finds the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$5$$$-th players in a row. These are players <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">E</span>. They are kicked out in the first round. </li><li> Now players are lined up as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ABD</span>. Nene finds the $$$3$$$-rd and the $$$5$$$-th players in a row. The $$$3$$$-rd player is player <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span> and there is no $$$5$$$-th player in a row. Thus, only player <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span> is kicked out in the second round. </li><li> In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. </li><li> Players <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span> are declared as the winners. </li></ul><p>Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene gave you $$$q$$$ integers $$$n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_q$$$ and you should answer the following question for each $$$1 \\le i \\le q$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">independently</span>:</p><ul> <li> How many people would be declared as winners if there are $$$n_i$$$ players in the game initially? </li></ul>",
