Each tile has an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most $$$n$$$ tiles</span> in the set have the same value. So the set can contain at most $$$n^2$$$ tiles.</p><p>You want to figure out which values are on the tiles. But Yui is shy, she prefers to play a guessing game with you.</p><p>Let's call a set consisting of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">three</span> tiles <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">triplet</span> if their values are the same. For example, $$$\\{2,\\,2,\\,2\\}$$$ is a triplet, but $$$\\{2,\\,3,\\,3\\}$$$ is not.</p><p>Let's call a set consisting of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">three</span> tiles <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">straight</span> if their values are consecutive integers. For example, $$$\\{2,\\,3,\\,4\\}$$$ is a straight, but $$$\\{1,\\,3,\\,5\\}$$$ is not.</p><p>At first, Yui gives you the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the initial set respectively. After that, you can insert a tile with an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ into the set <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most $$$n$$$ times</span>. Every time you insert a tile, you will get the number of triplet subsets and straight subsets of the current set as well.</p><p>Note that two tiles with the same value are treated different. In other words, in the set $$$\\{1,\\,1,\\,2,\\,2,\\,3\\}$$$ you can find $$$4$$$ subsets $$$\\{1,\\,2,\\,3\\}$$$.</p><p>Try to guess the number of tiles in the initial set with value $$$i$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p>",
