Vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n-1$$$ edges. Initially, Hanh sets the value of every vertex to $$$0$$$.</p><p>Now, Hanh performs $$$q$$$ operations, each is either of the following types: </p><ul> <li> Type $$$1$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and an integer $$$d$$$. Then he chooses some vertex $$$r$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">uniformly at random</span>, lists all vertices $$$u$$$ such that the path from $$$r$$$ to $$$u$$$ passes through $$$v$$$. Hanh then increases the value of all such vertices $$$u$$$ by $$$d$$$. </li><li> Type $$$2$$$: Hanh selects a vertex $$$v$$$ and calculates the expected value of $$$v$$$. </li></ul><p>Since Hanh is good at biology but not math, he needs your help on these operations.</p>",

It is guaranteed that these $$$n - 1$$$ edges form a tree.</p><p>Each of the last $$$q$$$ lines describes an operation in either formats: </p><ul> <li> $$$1$$$ $$$v$$$ $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\leq v \\leq n, 0 \\leq d \\leq 10^7$$$), representing a first-type operation. </li><li> $$$2$$$ $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq v \\leq n$$$), representing a second-type operation. </li></ul><p>It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.</p>",
