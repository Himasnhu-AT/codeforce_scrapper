    "statement": "<p>You are designing a new video game. It has $$$n$$$ scenarios, which the player may play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story. This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in other words, the video playing when switching from scenario $$$a$$$ to scenario $$$b$$$ is the same as the video playing when switching from scenario $$$b$$$ to scenario $$$a$$$. Therefore, you need to create $$$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$ different transition videos, one for each possible pair of different scenarios.</p><p>Each transition video can be either <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">funny</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">scary</span>. It is boring to see too many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than $$$\\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil$$$ transition videos of the same type in a row.</p><p>You have already come up with ideas for at most $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$ of the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.</p>",
