She picks a non-empty subset of the cards and multiplies all the numbers $$$a_i$$$ written on them.</p><p>Diana is happy when the product of the numbers ends with her favorite digit $$$d$$$. Now she is curious what cards she should pick so that the product of the numbers on them is the largest possible and the last decimal digit of the product is $$$d$$$. Please, help her.</p>",
