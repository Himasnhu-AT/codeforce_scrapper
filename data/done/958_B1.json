More precisely, some planets are connected by bidirectional hyperspace tunnels in such a way that there is a path between every pair of the planets, but removing any tunnel would disconnect some of them.</p><p>The Resistance already has measures in place that will, when the time is right, enable them to control every planet that is not <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">remote</span>. A planet is considered to be remote if it is connected to the rest of the planets only via a single hyperspace tunnel.</p><p>How much work is there left to be done: that is, how many remote planets are there?</p>",
