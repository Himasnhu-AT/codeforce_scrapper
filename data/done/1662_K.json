Due to the mobility restrictions in response to the pandemic, meetings are limited to $$$3$$$ persons, so you will only be able to meet $$$2$$$ of your friends at a time. Moreover, in order to contain the spread of the infection, the authorities have imposed the following additional measure: for each meeting, the sum of the lengths travelled by each of the attendees from their residence place to the place of the meeting must not exceed $$$r$$$.</p><p>What is the minimum value of $$$r$$$ (which can be any nonnegative real number) for which there exists a place of residence that allows you to hold the three possible meetings involving you and two of your friends? Note that the chosen place of residence need not have integer coordinates.</p>",
