    "statement": "<p>Mr. Chanek is currently participating in a science fair that is popular in town. He finds an exciting puzzle in the fair and wants to solve it.</p><p>There are $$$N$$$ atoms numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$. These atoms are especially quirky. Initially, each atom is in normal state. Each atom can be in an excited. Exciting atom $$$i$$$ requires $$$D_i$$$ energy. When atom $$$i$$$ is excited, it will give $$$A_i$$$ energy. You can excite any number of atoms (including zero).</p><p>These atoms also form a peculiar one-way bond. For each $$$i$$$, $$$(1 \\le i &lt; N)$$$, if atom $$$i$$$ is excited, atom $$$E_i$$$ will also be excited at no cost. Initially, $$$E_i$$$ = $$$i+1$$$. Note that atom $$$N$$$ cannot form a bond to any atom.</p><p>Mr. Chanek must change <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$K$$$ bonds. Exactly $$$K$$$ times, Mr. Chanek chooses an atom $$$i$$$, $$$(1 \\le i &lt; N)$$$ and changes $$$E_i$$$ to a different value other than $$$i$$$ and the current $$$E_i$$$. Note that an atom's bond can remain unchanged or changed more than once. Help Mr. Chanek determine the maximum energy that he can achieve!</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">note:</span> You must first change <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$K$$$ bonds before you can start exciting atoms.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ $$$K$$$ $$$(4 \\le N \\le 10^5, 0 \\le K &lt; N)$$$, the number of atoms, and the number of bonds that must be changed.</p><p>The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le A_i \\le 10^6)$$$, which denotes the energy given by atom $$$i$$$ when on excited state.</p><p>The third line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$D_i$$$ $$$(1 \\le D_i \\le 10^6)$$$, which denotes the energy needed to excite atom $$$i$$$.</p>",

    "note": "<p>An optimal solution to change $$$E_5$$$ to 1 and then excite atom 5 with energy 1. It will cause atoms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 be excited. The total energy gained by Mr. Chanek is (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10) - 1 = 35.</p><p>Another possible way is to change $$$E_3$$$ to 1 and then exciting atom 3 (which will excite atom 1, 2, 3) and exciting atom 4 (which will excite atom 4, 5, 6). The total energy gained by Mr. Chanek is (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 2) - (6 + 7) = 25 which is not optimal.</p>",
