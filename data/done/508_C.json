Anya has lots of candles prepared for the visits, each candle can produce light for exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> seconds. It takes the girl one second to light one candle. More formally, Anya can spend one second to light one candle, then this candle burns for exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> seconds and then goes out and can no longer be used.</p><p>For each of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> ghosts Anya knows the time at which it comes: the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th visit will happen <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds after midnight, all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>'s are distinct. Each visit lasts exactly one second.</p><p>What is the minimum number of candles Anya should use so that during each visit, at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> candles are burning? Anya can start to light a candle at any time that is integer number of seconds from midnight, possibly, at the time before midnight. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">That means, she can start to light a candle integer number of seconds before midnight or integer number of seconds after a midnight, or in other words in any integer moment of time.</span></p>",

But this candle isn't counted as burning at this visit.</span></p><p>It takes exactly one second to light up a candle and only after that second this candle is considered burning; it means that if Anya starts lighting candle at moment x, candle is buring from second x + 1 to second x + t inclusively.</p><p>In the first sample test three candles are enough. For example, Anya can start lighting them at the <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>-rd, <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span>-th and <span class=\"tex-span\">7</span>-th seconds after the midnight.</p><p>In the second sample test one candle is enough. For example, Anya can start lighting it one second before the midnight.</p><p>In the third sample test the answer is <span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009-\u20091</span>, since during each second at most one candle can burn but Anya needs three candles to light up the room at the moment when the ghost comes.</p>",
