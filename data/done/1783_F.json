A permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array of $$$n$$$ elements, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. The elements in each permutation are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p><p>You can perform the following operation any number of times:</p><ul> <li> choose an integer $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; </li><li> let $$$x$$$ be the integer such that $$$a_x = i$$$. Swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_x$$$; </li><li> let $$$y$$$ be the integer such that $$$b_y = i$$$. Swap $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_y$$$. </li></ul><p>Your goal is to make both permutations <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sorted in ascending order</span> (i.\u2009e. the conditions $$$a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; a_n$$$ and $$$b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; b_n$$$ must be satisfied) using <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum number of operations</span>.
