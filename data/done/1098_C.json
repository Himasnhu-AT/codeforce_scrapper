    "statement": "<p>Misha walked through the snowy forest and he was so fascinated by the trees to decide to draw his own tree!</p><p>Misha would like to construct a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, indexed from 1 to $$$n$$$, where the root has index 1. Every other vertex has a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">parent</span> $$$p_i$$$, and $$$i$$$ is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">child</span> of vertex $$$p_i$$$. Vertex $$$u$$$ belongs to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">subtree</span> of vertex $$$v$$$ iff $$$v$$$ is reachable from $$$u$$$ while iterating over the parents ($$$u$$$, $$$p_{u}$$$, $$$p_{p_{u}}$$$, ...). Clearly, $$$v$$$ belongs to its own subtree, and the number of vertices in the subtree is called the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">size</span> of the subtree. Misha is only interested in trees where every vertex belongs to the subtree of vertex $$$1$$$.</p><p>Below there is a tree with $$$6$$$ vertices. The subtree of vertex $$$2$$$ contains vertices $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$. Hence the size of its subtree is $$$4$$$. </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/509fd5ac83780174003f1f405de3d43146fc67e3.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">branching coefficient</span> of the tree is defined as the maximum number of children in any vertex. For example, for the tree above the branching coefficient equals $$$2$$$. Your task is to construct a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices such that the sum of the subtree sizes for all vertices equals $$$s$$$, and the branching coefficient is minimum possible.</p>",
