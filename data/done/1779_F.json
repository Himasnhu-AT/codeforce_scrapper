Therefore, he retired and decided to become a xorcerer.</span></p><p>One day, while taking a walk in a park, Misha came across a rooted tree with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The root of the tree is node $$$1$$$. </p><p>For each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, node $$$i$$$ contains $$$a_i$$$ stones in it. Misha has recently learned a new spell in his <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">xorcery</span> class and wants to test it out. A spell consists of:</p><ul> <li> Choose some node $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). </li><li> Calculate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR</a> $$$x$$$ of all $$$a_j$$$ such that node $$$j$$$ is in the subtree of $$$i$$$ ($$$i$$$ belongs to its own subtree). </li><li> Set $$$a_j$$$ equal to $$$x$$$ for all nodes $$$j$$$ in the subtree of $$$i$$$. </li></ul><p>Misha can perform at most $$$2n$$$ spells and he wants to remove all stones from the tree. More formally, he wants $$$a_i=0$$$ to hold for each $$$1\\leq i \\leq n$$$. Can you help him perform the spells?</p><p>A tree with $$$n$$$ nodes is a connected acyclic graph which contains $$$n-1$$$ edges. The subtree of node $$$i$$$ is the set of all nodes $$$j$$$ such that $$$i$$$ lies on the simple path from $$$1$$$ (the root) to $$$j$$$. We consider $$$i$$$ to be contained in its own subtree.</p>",
