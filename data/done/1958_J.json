    "statement": "<p>Monocarp is playing a computer game. In this game, his character is a necromancer. He is fighting $$$n$$$ monsters numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each monster has two parameters: health and strength.</p><p>Monocarp considers $$$q$$$ scenarios of the battle. In each scenario, he chooses some segment $$$[l, r]$$$ of monsters and calculates the number of moves it takes to defeat all these monsters.</p><p>Each scenario proceeds as follows. First, Monocarp kills monster $$$l$$$ and revives it as a zombie (this does not count as a move). Then each move the following happens: let $$$i$$$ be the index of the first monster in the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that is still alive. All zombies attack monster $$$i$$$, reducing its health by their total strength. After that, if monster $$$i$$$ has $$$0$$$ or less health, it dies and Monocarp revives it as a zombie.</p><p>When the monster is revived, the zombie's strength is equal to the monster's strength.</p><p>Help Monocarp for each scenario to calculate how many moves it will take to kill all the monsters in the segment.</p>",
