    "statement": "<p>Mr. Chanek's city can be represented as a plane. He wants to build a housing complex in the city.</p><p>There are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid $$$a$$$ of size $$$(n + 1) \\times (m + 1)$$$. There is a telephone pole at $$$(x, y)$$$ if $$$a_{x, y} = 1$$$.</p><p>For each point $$$(x, y)$$$, define $$$S(x, y)$$$ as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and $$$(x, y)$$$. Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$$.</p><p>To optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all $$$S(x, y)$$$ for each $$$0 \\leq x \\leq n$$$ and $$$0 \\leq y \\leq m$$$. Help him by finding the value of $$$\\sum_{x=0}^{n} {\\sum_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\leq n, m &lt; 2000$$$) \u2014 the size of the grid.</p><p>Then $$$(n + 1)$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$(m + 1)$$$ integers $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_{i, j} \\leq 1$$$) \u2014 the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.</p>",
