Vova and his classmates are supposed to write <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> progress tests, for each test they will get a mark from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span>. Vova is very smart and he can write every test for any mark, but he doesn't want to stand out from the crowd too much. If the sum of his marks for all tests exceeds value <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>, then his classmates notice how smart he is and start distracting him asking to let them copy his homework. And if the median of his marks will be lower than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span> points <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">(the definition of a median is given in the notes)</span>, then his mom will decide that he gets too many bad marks and forbid him to play computer games.</p><p>Vova has already wrote <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> tests and got marks <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>k</i></sub></span>. He doesn't want to get into the first or the second situation described above and now he needs to determine which marks he needs to get for the remaining tests. Help him do that.</p>",
