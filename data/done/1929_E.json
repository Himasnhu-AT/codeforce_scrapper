    "statement": "<p>Sasha was given a tree$$$^{\\dagger}$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices as a prize for winning yet another competition. However, upon returning home after celebrating his victory, he noticed that some parts of the tree were missing. Sasha remembers that he colored some of the edges of this tree. He is certain that for any of the $$$k$$$ pairs of vertices $$$(a_1, b_1), \\ldots, (a_k, b_k)$$$, he colored at least one edge on the simple path$$$^{\\ddagger}$$$ between vertices $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$.</p><p>Sasha does not remember how many edges he exactly colored, so he asks you to tell him the minimum number of edges he could have colored to satisfy the above condition.</p><p>$$$^{\\dagger}$$$A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.</p><p>$$$^{\\ddagger}$$$A simple path is a path that passes through each vertex at most once.</p>",
