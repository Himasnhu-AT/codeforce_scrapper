Now everyone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets inexpensively.</p><p>Each starship has a number\u00a0\u2014some positive integer $$$x$$$. Let's define the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">luckiness</span> of a number $$$x$$$ as the difference between the largest and smallest digits of that number. For example, $$$142857$$$ has $$$8$$$ as its largest digit and $$$1$$$ as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is $$$8-1=7$$$. And the number $$$111$$$ has all digits equal to $$$1$$$, so its luckiness is zero.</p><p>Hateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to different corners of the solar system. To release interesting videos even faster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the store, he saw starships with numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively. While in the store, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the luckiest number.</p><p>Since there are a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't program, you have to help the blogger and write a program that answers his question.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/bae36202463d58e4e2df41b76cafa5d805f6f1e8.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center>",
