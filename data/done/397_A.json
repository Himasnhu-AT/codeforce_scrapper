    "statement": "<p>Our old friend Alexey has finally entered the University of City N \u2014 the Berland capital. Alexey expected his father to get him a place to live in but his father said it was high time for Alexey to practice some financial independence. So, Alexey is living in a dorm. </p><p>The dorm has exactly one straight dryer \u2014 a <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span> centimeter long rope to hang clothes on. The dryer has got a coordinate system installed: the leftmost end of the dryer has coordinate <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>, and the opposite end has coordinate <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span>. Overall, the university has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> students. Dean's office allows <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th student to use the segment <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,\u2009<i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>)</span> of the dryer. However, the dean's office actions are contradictory and now one part of the dryer can belong to multiple students!</p><p>Alexey don't like when someone touch his clothes. That's why he want make it impossible to someone clothes touch his ones. So Alexey wonders: what is the total length of the parts of the dryer that he may use in a such way that clothes of the others <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091)</span> students aren't drying there. Help him! Note that Alexey, as the most respected student, has number 1.</p>",

The <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>i</i>\u2009+\u20091)</span>-th line contains integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">0\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009&lt;\u2009<i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009100</span>) \u2014\u00a0the endpoints of the corresponding segment for the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th student.</p>",
