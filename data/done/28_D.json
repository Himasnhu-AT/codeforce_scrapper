    "statement": "<p>A motorcade of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> trucks, driving from city \u00abZ\u00bb to city \u00ab\u0417\u00bb, has approached a tunnel, known as Tunnel of Horror. Among truck drivers there were rumours about monster DravDe, who hunts for drivers in that tunnel. Some drivers fear to go first, others - to be the last, but let's consider the general case. Each truck is described with four numbers: </p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> \u2014 value of the truck, of its passangers and cargo </li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span> \u2014 amount of passanger on the truck, the driver included </li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> \u2014 total amount of people that should go into the tunnel before this truck, so that the driver can overcome his fear (\u00abif the monster appears in front of the motorcade, he'll eat them first\u00bb) </li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> \u2014 total amount of people that should follow this truck, so that the driver can overcome his fear (\u00abif the monster appears behind the motorcade, he'll eat them first\u00bb). </li></ul><p>Since the road is narrow, it's impossible to escape DravDe, if he appears from one side. Moreover, the motorcade can't be rearranged. The order of the trucks can't be changed, but it's possible to take any truck out of the motorcade, and leave it near the tunnel for an indefinite period. You, as the head of the motorcade, should remove some of the trucks so, that the rest of the motorcade can move into the tunnel and the total amount of the left trucks' values is maximal. </p>",
