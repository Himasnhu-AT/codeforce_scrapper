    "statement": "<p>Leo Jr. draws pictures in his notebook with checkered sheets (that is, each sheet has a regular square grid printed on it). We can assume that the sheets are infinitely large in any direction.</p><p>To draw a picture, Leo Jr. colors some of the cells on a sheet gray. He considers the resulting picture <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><ul><li> The picture is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">connected</span>, that is, it is possible to get from any gray cell to any other by following a chain of gray cells, with each pair of adjacent cells in the path being neighbours (that is, sharing a side).</li><li> Each gray cell has an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even number of gray neighbours</span>.</li><li> There are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly $$$n$$$ gray cells with all gray neighbours</span>. The number of other gray cells can be arbitrary <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">(but reasonable, so that they can all be listed)</span>.</li></ul><p>Leo Jr. is now struggling to draw a beautiful picture with a particular choice of $$$n$$$. Help him, and provide any example of a beautiful picture.</p><p>To output cell coordinates in your answer, assume that the sheet is provided with a Cartesian coordinate system such that one of the cells is chosen to be the origin $$$(0, 0)$$$, axes $$$0x$$$ and $$$0y$$$ are orthogonal and parallel to grid lines, and a unit step along any axis in any direction takes you to a neighbouring cell.</p>",
