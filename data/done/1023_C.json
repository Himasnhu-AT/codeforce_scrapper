A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()()</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(())</span>\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(1)+(1)</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">((1+1)+1)</span>\"), and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)(</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)</span>\" are not.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</span></p><p>You are given a regular bracket sequence $$$s$$$ and an integer number $$$k$$$.
