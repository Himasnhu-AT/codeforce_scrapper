    "statement": "<p>Limak is a little polar bear. His parents told him to clean a house before the New Year's Eve. Their house is a rectangular grid with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span> rows and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i></span> columns. Each cell is an empty square.</p><p>He is a little bear and thus he can't clean a house by himself. Instead, he is going to use a cleaning robot.</p><p>A cleaning robot has a built-in pattern of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> moves, defined by a string of the length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. A single move (character) moves a robot to one of four adjacent cells. Each character is one of the following four: '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>' (up), '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>' (down), '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>' (left), '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>' (right). One move takes one minute.</p><p>A cleaning robot must be placed and started in some cell. Then it repeats its pattern of moves till it hits a wall (one of four borders of a house). After hitting a wall it can be placed and used again.</p><p>Limak isn't sure if placing a cleaning robot in one cell will be enough. Thus, he is going to start it <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i>\u00b7<i>h</i></span> times, one time in each cell. Maybe some cells will be cleaned more than once but who cares?</p><p>Limak asks you one question. How much time will it take to clean a house? Find and print the number of minutes modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097</span>. It's also possible that a cleaning robot will never stop\u00a0\u2014 then print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>\" (without the quotes) instead.</p><p>Placing and starting a robot takes no time, however, you must count a move when robot hits a wall. Take a look into samples for further clarification.</p>",
