    "statement": "<p>Christmas is coming, Icy has just received a box of chocolates from her grandparents! The box contains $$$n$$$ chocolates. The $$$i$$$-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type $$$a_i$$$.</p><p>Icy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all $$$a_i$$$ are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span>). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. </p><p>As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">chocolate exchanges</span>. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Before performing any chocolate exchanges</span>, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$, $$$x \\ne y$$$).</p><p>In a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">chocolate exchange</span>, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer $$$k$$$, such that $$$2^k \\ge a_x$$$, and change the type of the chocolate $$$x$$$ from $$$a_x$$$ to $$$2^k - a_x$$$ (that is, perform $$$a_x := 2^k - a_x$$$).</p><p>The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when $$$a_x = a_y$$$. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.</span></p><p>Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimizes</span> the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximize</span> the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair $$$(x, y)$$$ such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of $$$(x, y)$$$.</p><p>Since Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.</p>",

Your output must satisfy $$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$, $$$x \\ne y$$$.</p><p>$$$m$$$ is the number of exchanges needed to obtain $$$a_x = a_y$$$.
