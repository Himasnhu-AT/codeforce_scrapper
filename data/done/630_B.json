The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.</p><p>You are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">1.000000011</span> times.</p>",
