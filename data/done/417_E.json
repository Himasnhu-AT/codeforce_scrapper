He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span>, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.</p><p>Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">8</sup></span>.</p>",
