    "statement": "<p>Simon and Antisimon play a game. Initially each player receives one fixed positive integer that doesn't change throughout the game. Simon receives number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and Antisimon receives number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>. They also have a heap of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> stones. The players take turns to make a move and Simon starts. During a move a player should take from the heap the number of stones equal to the greatest common divisor of the fixed number he has received and the number of stones left in the heap. A player loses when he cannot take the required number of stones (i. e. the heap has <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">strictly</span> less stones left than one needs to take). </p><p>Your task is to determine by the given <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> who wins the game.</p>",
