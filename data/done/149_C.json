From time to time they have a break to have some food or do some chores (for example, water the flowers).</p><p>The key in football is to divide into teams fairly before the game begins. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> boys playing football in the yard (including Petya), each boy's football playing skill is expressed with a non-negative characteristic <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (the larger it is, the better the boy plays). </p><p>Let's denote the number of players in the first team as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>, the number of players in the second team as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span>, the individual numbers of boys who play for the first team as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and the individual numbers of boys who play for the second team as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. Division <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> boys into two teams is considered fair if three conditions are fulfilled:</p><ul> <li> Each boy plays for exactly one team (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009+\u2009<i>y</i>\u2009=\u2009<i>n</i></span>). </li><li> The sizes of teams differ in no more than one (<span class=\"tex-span\">|<i>x</i>\u2009-\u2009<i>y</i>|\u2009\u2264\u20091</span>). </li><li> The total football playing skills for two teams differ in no more than by the value of skill the best player in the yard has.
