This time, he comes up with two types of operations:</p><ul> <li> Choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and increment $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j$$$ which is a multiple of $$$i$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$. </li><li> Choose any $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$) and decrement $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$ for every $$$j$$$ which is a multiple of $$$i$$$ and $$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$. </li></ul><p>He wants to convert array $$$a$$$ into an array $$$b$$$ using the minimum total number of operations. However, Jeevan seems to have forgotten the value of $$$b_1$$$. So he makes some guesses. He will ask you $$$q$$$ questions corresponding to his $$$q$$$ guesses, the $$$i$$$-th of which is of the form: </p><ul> <li> If $$$b_1 = x_i$$$, what is the minimum number of operations required to convert $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$? </li></ul><p>Help him by answering each question.</p>",
