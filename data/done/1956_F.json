The $$$i$$$-th player has an <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">arm interval</span> $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$. Two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\neq j$$$) can pass the ball to each other if and only if $$$|i-j|\\in[l_i+l_j,r_i+r_j]$$$ (here, $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$).</p><p>Nene wants to test the cooperation ability of these players. In order to do this, she will hold several rounds of assessment.</p><ul> <li> In each round, Nene will select a sequence of players $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m$$$ such that players $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i+1}$$$ can pass the ball to each other for all $$$1 \\le i &lt; m$$$. The length of the sequence $$$m$$$ can be chosen by Nene. Each player can appear in the sequence $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m$$$ multiple times or not appear in it at all. </li><li> Then, Nene will throw a ball to player $$$p_1$$$, player $$$p_1$$$ will pass the ball to player $$$p_2$$$ and so on... Player $$$p_m$$$ will throw a ball away from the basketball court so it can no longer be used. </li></ul><p>As a coach, Nene wants each of $$$n$$$ players to appear in at least one round of assessment. Since Nene has to go on a date after school, Nene wants you to calculate the minimum number of rounds of assessment needed to complete the task.</p>",
