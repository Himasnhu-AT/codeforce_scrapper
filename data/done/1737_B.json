She counts the days since she started these activities, in which the day she starts is numbered as day $$$1$$$. A \"Luxury\" day is the day in which the number of this day is a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">luxurious number</span>. </p><p>An integer $$$x$$$ is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">luxurious number</span> if it is divisible by $$${\\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor}$$$.</p><p>Here $$$\\lfloor r \\rfloor$$$ denotes the <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">\"floor\"</span> of a real number $$$r$$$. In other words, it's the largest integer not greater than $$$r$$$.</p><p>For example: $$$8$$$, $$$56$$$, $$$100$$$ are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">luxurious numbers</span>, since $$$8$$$ is divisible by $$$\\lfloor \\sqrt{8} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.8284 \\rfloor = 2$$$, $$$56$$$ is divisible $$$\\lfloor \\sqrt{56} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 7.4833 \\rfloor = 7$$$, and $$$100$$$ is divisible by $$$\\lfloor \\sqrt{100} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10 \\rfloor = 10$$$, respectively. On the other hand $$$5$$$, $$$40$$$ are not, since $$$5$$$ are not divisible by $$$\\lfloor \\sqrt{5} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.2361 \\rfloor = 2$$$, and $$$40$$$ are not divisible by $$$\\lfloor \\sqrt{40} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 6.3246 \\rfloor = 6$$$.</p><p>Being a friend of Ela, you want to engage in these fitness activities with her to keep her and yourself accompanied (and have fun together, of course).
