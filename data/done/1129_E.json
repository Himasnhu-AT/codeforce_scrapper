Legend has it that individuals who realize this tree would eternally become a Legendary Grandmaster.</p><p>To help you determine the tree, Mikaela the Goddess has revealed to you that the tree contains $$$n$$$ vertices, enumerated from $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. She also allows you to ask her some questions as follows. For each question, you should tell Mikaela some two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">disjoint</span> non-empty sets of vertices $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$, along with any vertex $$$v$$$ that you like. Then, Mikaela will count and give you the number of pairs of vertices $$$(s, t)$$$ where $$$s \\in S$$$ and $$$t \\in T$$$ such that the simple path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ contains $$$v$$$.</p><p>Mikaela the Goddess is busy and will be available to answer at most $$$11\\,111$$$ questions.</p><p>This is your only chance.
