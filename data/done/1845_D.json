    "statement": "<p>You are developing a rating system for an online game. Every time a player participates in a match, the player's rating changes depending on the results.</p><p>Initially, the player's rating is $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ matches; after the $$$i$$$-th match, the rating change is equal to $$$a_i$$$ (the rating increases by $$$a_i$$$ if $$$a_i$$$ is positive, or decreases by $$$|a_i|$$$ if it's negative. There are no zeros in the sequence $$$a$$$).</p><p>The system has an additional rule: for a fixed integer $$$k$$$, if a player's rating has reached the value $$$k$$$, it will never fall below it. Formally, if a player's rating at least $$$k$$$, and a rating change would make it less than $$$k$$$, then the rating will decrease <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to exactly $$$k$$$</span>.</p><p>Your task is to determine the value $$$k$$$ in such a way that the player's rating after all $$$n$$$ matches is the maximum possible (among all integer values of $$$k$$$). If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.</p>",
