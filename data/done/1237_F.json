Every cell is covered by at most one domino.</p><p>Let's call a placement of dominoes on the grid <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">perfectly balanced</span> if no row and no column contains a pair of cells covered by two different dominoes. In other words, every row and column may contain no covered cells, one covered cell, or two covered cells that belong to the same domino.</p><p>You are given a perfectly balanced placement of dominoes on a grid. Find the number of ways to place zero or more extra dominoes on this grid to keep the placement perfectly balanced. Output this number modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",

The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$h$$$, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$w$$$.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains four integers $$$r_{i, 1}, c_{i, 1}, r_{i, 2}, c_{i, 2}$$$ ($$$1 \\le r_{i, 1} \\le r_{i, 2} \\le h$$$; $$$1 \\le c_{i, 1} \\le c_{i, 2} \\le w$$$), denoting the row id and the column id of the cells covered by the $$$i$$$-th domino.
