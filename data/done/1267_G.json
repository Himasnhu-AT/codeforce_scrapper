Recently, a new video game Dota\u00a03 was released. In Dota\u00a03 a player can buy some relics for their hero. Relics are counters that track hero's actions and statistics in a game.</p><p>Gloria likes to play Dota\u00a03, so she wants to buy all $$$n$$$ available relics for her favorite hero.</p><p>Relics can be bought using an in-game currency called shards. Each relic has its own price\u00a0\u2014 $$$c_i$$$ shards for the $$$i$$$-th relic. A player can buy a relic using one of the following options: </p><ul> <li> Pay $$$c_i$$$ shards to buy the $$$i$$$-th relic; </li><li> Pay $$$x$$$ shards and randomly get one of all $$$n$$$ relics. The probability of getting a relic is the same for all $$$n$$$ relics. If a duplicate relic is received, then the relic is recycled and $$$\\frac{x}{2}$$$ shards are given back to the player. </li></ul><p>Gloria wants to buy all $$$n$$$ relics.

The expected number of shards to spend in this scenario is $$$20 + 30 = 50$$$.</p><p>In the second scenario, Gloria initially gets the second relic. Then it is better to buy the first relic for $$$25$$$ shards, so the expected number of shards to spend in this scenario is $$$20 + 25 = 45$$$.</p><p>Thus, the expected number of shards to spend is $$$\\frac{50 + 45}{2} = 47.5$$$.</p>",
