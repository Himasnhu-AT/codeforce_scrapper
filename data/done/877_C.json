Slava doesn't know the number of tanks and their positions, because he flies very high, but he can drop a bomb in any cell. All tanks in this cell will be damaged.</p><p>If a tank takes damage for the first time, it instantly moves to one of the neighboring cells (a tank in the cell <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> can only move to the cell <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>, a tank in the cell <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> can only move to the cell <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>). If a tank takes damage for the second time, it's counted as destroyed and never moves again. The tanks move only when they are damaged for the first time, they do not move by themselves.</p><p>Help Slava to destroy all tanks using as few bombs as possible.</p>",
