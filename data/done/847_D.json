    "statement": "<p>A new dog show on TV is starting next week. On the show dogs are required to demonstrate bottomless stomach, strategic thinking and self-preservation instinct. You and your dog are invited to compete with other participants and naturally you want to win!</p><p>On the show a dog needs to eat as many bowls of dog food as possible (bottomless stomach helps here). Dogs compete separately of each other and the rules are as follows:</p><p>At the start of the show the dog and the bowls are located on a line. The dog starts at position <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009=\u20090</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> bowls are located at positions <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009=\u20091,\u2009<i>x</i>\u2009=\u20092,\u2009...,\u2009<i>x</i>\u2009=\u2009<i>n</i></span>. The bowls are numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> from left to right. After the show starts the dog immediately begins to run to the right to the first bowl.</p><p>The food inside bowls is not ready for eating at the start because it is too hot (dog's self-preservation instinct prevents eating). More formally, the dog can eat from the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th bowl after <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds from the start of the show or later.</p><p>It takes dog 1 second to move from the position <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> to the position <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009+\u20091</span>. The dog is not allowed to move to the left, the dog runs only to the right with the constant speed 1 distance unit per second. When the dog reaches a bowl (say, the bowl <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>), the following cases are possible:</p><ul> <li> the food had cooled down (i.e. it passed at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds from the show start): the dog immediately eats the food and runs to the right without any stop, </li><li> the food is hot (i.e. it passed less than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds from the show start): the dog has two options: to wait for the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th bowl, eat the food and continue to run at the moment <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> or to skip the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th bowl and continue to run to the right without any stop. </li></ul><p>After <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> seconds from the start the show ends. If the dog reaches a bowl of food at moment <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> the dog can not eat it. The show stops before <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> seconds if the dog had run to the right of the last bowl.</p><p>You need to help your dog create a strategy with which the maximum possible number of bowls of food will be eaten in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> seconds.</p>",
