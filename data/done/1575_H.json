    "statement": "<p>The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. His favorite nephew has another binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\leq n$$$).</p><p>Mr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer $$$k$$$. His nephew wants exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ as substrings in $$$a$$$. </p><p>However, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of $$$k$$$. So, for each $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \\leq k \\leq n - m + 1$$$), find the minimum number of elements in $$$a$$$ that have to be changed such that there are exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ in $$$a$$$.</p><p>A string $$$s$$$ occurs exactly $$$k$$$ times in $$$t$$$ if there are exactly $$$k$$$ different pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ such that we can obtain $$$s$$$ by deleting $$$p$$$ characters from the beginning and $$$q$$$ characters from the end of $$$t$$$.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output $$$n - m + 2$$$ integers \u2014 the $$$(k+1)$$$-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in $$$a$$$ that have to be changed so there are exactly $$$k$$$ occurrences of $$$b$$$ as a substring in $$$a$$$.</p>",
