After receiving all the answers Petya should determine the number that Vasya thought of.</p><p>Unfortunately, Petya is not familiar with the number theory. Help him find the minimum number of questions he should ask to make a guaranteed guess of Vasya's number, and the numbers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, he should ask the questions about.</p>",
