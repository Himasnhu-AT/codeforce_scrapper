    "statement": "<p>Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!</p><p>Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> factorial\" and \"<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD<span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>A</i>!,\u2009<i>B</i>!)</span>. It's well known that the factorial of an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>. Thus <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(<i>x</i>\u2009-\u20091)\u00b7<i>x</i></span>. For example <span class=\"tex-span\">4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924</span>. Recall that GCD<span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>x</i>,\u2009<i>y</i>)</span> is the largest positive integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i></span> that divides (without a remainder) both <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span>.</p><p>Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you?</p>",
