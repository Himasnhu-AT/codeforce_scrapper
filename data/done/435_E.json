The graph's vertices are the nodes of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> grid. The graph's edges are all the sides and diagonals of the grid's unit squares.</p><p>The figure below shows a <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20095</span> graph. The black lines are the graph's edges, the colored circles are the graph's vertices. The vertices of the graph are painted on the picture for a reason: the coloring is a correct vertex coloring of the <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20095</span> graph into four colors. A graph coloring is correct if and only if each vertex is painted and no two vertices connected by an edge are painted the same color.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/6ff4617b587b03d9d4f33d18eb6216c3bbe5e594.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>You are given the size of the grid graph <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> and the colors of some of its vertices.
