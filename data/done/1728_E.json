Monocarp won't add both peppers to any dish, won't add any pepper multiple times, and won't leave any dish without the pepper added.</p><p>Before adding the pepper, Monocarp should first purchase the said pepper in some shop. There are $$$m$$$ shops in his local area. The $$$j$$$-th of them has packages of red pepper sufficient for $$$x_j$$$ servings and packages of black pepper sufficient for $$$y_j$$$ servings.</p><p>Monocarp goes to exactly one shop, purchases multiple (possibly, zero) packages of each pepper in such a way that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">each dish will get the pepper added once, and no pepper is left</span>.

The optimal choice turns out to be either $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ or $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$. Monocarp can add black pepper to the first dish, red pepper to the second dish and any pepper to the third dish, the total is $$$10 + 100 + 2 = 112$$$.</p><p>In the third shop, Monocarp can only buy $$$1$$$ red pepper package and $$$0$$$ black pepper packages. Red pepper added to all dishes will sum up to $$$5 + 100 + 2 = 107$$$.</p><p>In the fourth shop, Monocarp can only buy an even total number of packages.
