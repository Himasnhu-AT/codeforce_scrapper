After that they paint all the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> its vertices, so that the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th vertex gets color <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>.</p><p>Now it's time for Timofey birthday, and his mother asked him to remove the tree. Timofey removes the tree in the following way: he takes some vertex in hands, while all the other vertices move down so that the tree becomes rooted at the chosen vertex. After that Timofey brings the tree to a trash can.</p><p>Timofey doesn't like it when many colors are mixing together. A subtree annoys him if there are vertices of different color in it. Timofey wants to find a vertex which he should take in hands so that there are no subtrees that annoy him. He doesn't consider the whole tree as a subtree since he can't see the color of the root vertex.</p><p>A subtree of some vertex is a subgraph containing that vertex and all its descendants.</p><p>Your task is to determine if there is a vertex, taking which in hands Timofey wouldn't be annoyed.</p>",
