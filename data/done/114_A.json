    "statement": "<p>When Petya went to school, he got interested in large numbers and what they were called in ancient times. For instance, he learned that the Russian word \"tma\" (which now means \"too much to be counted\") used to stand for a thousand and \"tma tmyschaya\" (which literally means \"the tma of tmas\") used to stand for a million.</p><p>Petya wanted to modernize the words we use for numbers and invented a word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium</span> that represents number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. Moreover, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium la petricium</span> stands for number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup></span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium la petricium la petricium</span> stands for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup></span> and so on. All numbers of this form are called <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petriciumus cifera</span>, and the number's importance is the number of articles <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">la</span> in its title.</p><p>Petya's invention brought on a challenge that needed to be solved quickly: does some number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> belong to the set <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petriciumus cifera</span>? As Petya is a very busy schoolboy he needs to automate the process, he asked you to solve it.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>You should print in the first line of the output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\", if the number belongs to the set <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petriciumus cifera</span> and otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\".
