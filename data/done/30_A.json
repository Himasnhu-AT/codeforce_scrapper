    "statement": "<p>A long time ago in some far country lived king Copa. After the recent king's reform, he got so large powers that started to keep the books by himself.</p><p>The total income <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> of his kingdom during <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>-th year is known, as well as the total income <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> during <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>-th year (these numbers can be negative \u2014 it means that there was a loss in the correspondent year). </p><p>King wants to show financial stability. To do this, he needs to find common coefficient <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>X</i></span> \u2014 the coefficient of income growth during one year. This coefficient should satisfy the equation:</p><center class=\"tex-equation\"><span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i>\u00b7<i>X</i><sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>n</i></sup>\u2009=\u2009<i>B</i>.</span></center><p>Surely, the king is not going to do this job by himself, and demands you to find such number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>X</i></span>.</p><p>It is necessary to point out that the fractional numbers are not used in kingdom's economy. That's why all input numbers as well as coefficient <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>X</i></span> must be integers. The number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>X</i></span> may be zero or negative.</p>",
