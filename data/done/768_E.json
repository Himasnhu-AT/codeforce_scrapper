    "statement": "<p>Sam has been teaching Jon the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Game of Stones</span> to sharpen his mind and help him devise a strategy to fight the white walkers. The rules of this game are quite simple: </p><ul><li> The game starts with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> piles of stones indexed from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. The <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th pile contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> stones.</li><li> The players make their moves alternatively. A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> stones does not count as a move.</li><li> The player who is unable to make a move loses.</li></ul><p>Now Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.</p><p>In this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile. For example, if <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> stones are removed from a pile, <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> stones cannot be removed from that pile again.</p><p>Sam sets up the game and makes the first move. Jon believes that Sam is just trying to prevent him from going to battle. Jon wants to know if he can win if both play optimally.</p>",
