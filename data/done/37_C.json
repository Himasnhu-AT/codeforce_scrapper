Every word consisted of two letters, <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. Ancient Berland people spoke quickly and didn\u2019t make pauses between the words, but at the same time they could always understand each other perfectly. It was possible because no word was a prefix of another one. The prefix of a string is considered to be one of its substrings that starts from the initial symbol.</p><p>Help the scientists determine whether all the words of the Old Berland language can be reconstructed and if they can, output the words themselves.</p>",
