    "statement": "<p>Vittorio is playing with his new LEGO Duplo bricks. All the bricks have the shape of a square cuboid with a $$$2 \\times 2$$$ square base and a height of $$$1$$$. They can be arranged in the 3D space to build structures, provided that the following rules are met:</p><ol><li> No two bricks can intersect, but they can touch on their faces.</li><li> The corners of every brick must have integer coordinates (so bricks are axis-aligned) and the $$$z$$$ coordinates of all corners must be non-negative.</li><li> The square bases of every brick must be parallel to the ground (i.e. the plane $$$z=0$$$).</li><li> The lower base of any brick that is not touching the ground must touch the upper base of some other brick in a region of positive area (when this happens, the two bricks stay attached to each other thanks to small studs).</li></ol><p>For example, this is a valid structure:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9afb503018bc602002aa5e9fefb7b294f7df1d8d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Vittorio wants to build a structure that includes purple bricks in the following $$$n$$$ positions: $$$(x_1, 0, h)$$$, $$$(x_2, 0, h)$$$, $$$\\dots$$$, $$$(x_n, 0, h)$$$ \u2014 these are the coordinates of the centers of their lower bases; note that all of these bricks have $$$y$$$ coordinate equal to $$$0$$$ and $$$z$$$ coordinate equal to $$$h$$$. Vittorio will use additional bricks of other colors to support the purple bricks. He is willing to place bricks only in positions where the center of the lower base has $$$y$$$ coordinate equal to $$$0$$$. What is the minimum number of additional bricks needed?</p><p>It can be shown that a valid construction always exists.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 300$$$, $$$0 \\le h \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the number of purple bricks and their common $$$z$$$ coordinate.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, \\, x_2, \\, \\dots, \\, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9$$$, $$$x_i + 1 &lt; x_{i+1}$$$) \u2014 the $$$x$$$ coordinates of the purple bricks (centers of the bases), given in increasing order.</p>",

For example, he can place additional bricks at positions $$$(3, 0, 0)$$$, $$$(7, 0, 0)$$$ and $$$(12, 0, 0)$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to build a valid construction using less than $$$3$$$ additional bricks.</p><p>In the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">fourth sample</span>, a possible structure that minimizes the number of additional bricks is shown in the problem description.</p>",
