A slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.</p><p>For example, suppose $$$n = 5$$$, $$$a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4]$$$. The process can go as follows:</p><ul> <li> first, the $$$3$$$-rd slime eats the $$$2$$$-nd slime. The size of the $$$3$$$-rd slime becomes $$$5$$$, the $$$2$$$-nd slime is eaten. </li><li> then, the $$$3$$$-rd slime eats the $$$1$$$-st slime (they are neighbors since the $$$2$$$-nd slime is already eaten).
