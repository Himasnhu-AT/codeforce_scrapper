The college dormitory at MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">tree</span> is a connected undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n-1$$$ edges.</p><p>Tonight, there are three types of students: </p><ul> <li> students who want to party and play music (marked with $$$\\texttt{P}$$$), </li><li> students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with $$$\\texttt{S}$$$), and </li><li> students who don't care (marked with $$$\\texttt{C}$$$). </li></ul><p>Initially, all the edges are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">thin</span> walls which allow music to pass through, so when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room. However, we can place some <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">thick</span> walls on any edges\u00a0\u2014 thick walls don't allow music to pass through them.</p><p>The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.</p><p>Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.</p>",
