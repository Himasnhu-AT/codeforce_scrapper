    "statement": "<p>Vitaly gave Maxim $$$n$$$ numbers $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ for his $$$16$$$-th birthday. Maxim was tired of playing board games during the celebration, so he decided to play with these numbers. In one step Maxim can choose two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the numbers he has, throw them away, and add two numbers $$$x + y$$$ and $$$|x - y|$$$ instead. He wants all his numbers to be equal after several steps and the sum of the numbers to be minimal.</p><p>Help Maxim to find a solution. Maxim's friends don't want to wait long, so the number of steps in the solution should not exceed $$$20n$$$. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, if a solution exists, then there exists a solution that makes all numbers equal, minimizes their sum, and spends no more than $$$20n$$$ moves.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 25\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of integers given to Maxim.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ doesn't exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case print $$$-1$$$ if it's impossible to make all numbers equal.</p><p>Otherwise print a single integer $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \\le s \\le 20n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of steps. Then print $$$s$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line must contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$\u00a0\u2014 numbers that Maxim chooses on the $$$i$$$-th step. The numbers must become equal after all operations.</p><p>Don't forget that you not only need to make all numbers equal, but also minimize their sum. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, if a solution exists, then there exists a solution that makes all numbers equal, minimizes their sum, and spends no more than $$$20n$$$ moves.</p>",
