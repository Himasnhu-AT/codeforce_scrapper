Bob didn't like this idea, but he couldn't refuse Alice, so he asked you to write a program that would play instead of him.</p><p>The game starts with Alice taking out a grid sheet of size $$$n \\times n$$$, the cells of which are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">initially not colored</span>. After that she colors some $$$2n$$$ cells with colors $$$1,2,\\ldots, 2n$$$, respectively, and informs Bob about these cells.</p><p>In one move, Bob can point to a cell that has not been colored yet and ask Alice to color that cell. Alice colors that cell with one of the $$$2n$$$ colors of her choice, informing Bob of the chosen color. Bob can make no more than $$$10$$$ moves, after which he needs to find a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">good</span> set of four cells.</p><p>A set of four cells is considered good if the following conditions are met:</p><ul> <li> All the cells in the set are colored; </li><li> No two cells in the set are colored with the same color; </li><li> The centers of the cells form a rectangle with sides parallel to the grid lines. </li></ul>",
