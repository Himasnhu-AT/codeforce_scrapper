He has a checkered field of size <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>n</i></span> cells, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> various cells are banned. Before the game, he has to put a few chips on some border (but not corner) board cells. Then for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> minutes, Gerald every minute moves each chip into an adjacent cell. He moves each chip from its original edge to the opposite edge. Gerald loses in this game in each of the three cases:</p><ul> <li> At least one of the chips at least once fell to the banned cell. </li><li> At least once two chips were on the same cell. </li><li> At least once two chips swapped in a minute (for example, if you stand two chips on two opposite border cells of a row with even length, this situation happens in the middle of the row). </li></ul><p>In that case he loses and earns <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> points. When nothing like that happened, he wins and earns the number of points equal to the number of chips he managed to put on the board. Help Gerald earn the most points.</p>",
