    "statement": "<p>Salem gave you $$$n$$$ sticks with integer positive lengths $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$.</p><p>For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ is $$$|a - b|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$.</p><p>A stick length $$$a_i$$$ is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">almost good</span> for some integer $$$t$$$ if $$$|a_i - t| \\le 1$$$.</p><p>Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $$$t$$$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $$$t$$$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. </p><p>As an answer, print the value of $$$t$$$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $$$t$$$, print any of them.</p>",
