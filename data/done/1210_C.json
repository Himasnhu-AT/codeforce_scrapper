In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?</p><p>You're given a tree \u2014 a connected undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices connected by $$$n - 1$$$ edges. The tree is rooted at vertex $$$1$$$. A vertex $$$u$$$ is called an <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">ancestor</span> of $$$v$$$ if it lies on the shortest path between the root and $$$v$$$. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.</p><p>Each vertex $$$v$$$ is assigned its <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beauty</span> $$$x_v$$$ \u2014 a non-negative integer not larger than $$$10^{12}$$$. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let $$$u$$$ be an ancestor of $$$v$$$. Then we define the beauty $$$f(u, v)$$$ as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. Formally, if $$$u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \\dots, t_k=v$$$ are the vertices on the shortest path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, then $$$f(u, v) = \\gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \\dots, x_{t_k})$$$. Here, $$$\\gcd$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, $$$f(u, u) = \\gcd(x_u) = x_u$$$.</p><p>Your task is to find the sum</p><p>$$$$$$ \\sum_{u\\text{ is an ancestor of }v} f(u, v). $$$$$$</p><p>As the result might be too large, please output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.</p><p>Note that for each $$$y$$$, $$$\\gcd(0, y) = \\gcd(y, 0) = y$$$. In particular, $$$\\gcd(0, 0) = 0$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100\\,000$$$) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le x_i \\le 10^{12}$$$). The value $$$x_v$$$ denotes the beauty of vertex $$$v$$$.</p><p>The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges of the tree. Each of them contains two integers $$$a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le n$$$, $$$a \\neq b$$$) \u2014 the vertices connected by a single edge.</p>",
