The answer may be large, so output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p><p>Recall that the subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ is a sequence that can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by removing some (possibly, zero) elements. For example, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$ are subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, but $$$[3, 2]$$$ and $$$[4, 5, 6]$$$ are not.</p><p>Note that $$$\\mathsf{AND}$$$ represents the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND operation</a>.</p>",
