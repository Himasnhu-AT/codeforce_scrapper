There is a room in front of Rudolph with $$$n$$$ different objects scattered around. Among the objects there is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> amazing creature \u2014 a mimic that can turn into any object. He has already disguised himself in this room and Rudolph needs to find him by experiment.</p><p>The experiment takes place in several stages. At each stage, the following happens:</p><ul><li> Rudolf looks at all the objects in the room and writes down their types. The type of each object is indicated by a number; there can be several objects of the same type.</li><li> After inspecting, Rudolph can point to an object that he thinks is a mimic. After that, the experiment ends. Rudolph only has one try, so if he is unsure of the mimic's position, he does the next step instead.</li><li> Rudolf can remove any number of objects from the room (possibly zero). Then Rudolf leaves the room and at this time all objects, including the mimic, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">are mixed</span> with each other, their order is changed, and the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">mimic can transform</span> into any other object (even one that is not in the room).</li><li> After this, Rudolf returns to the room and repeats the stage. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">mimic may not change appearance</span>, but it can not remain a same object for more than two stages in a row.</li></ul><p>Rudolf's task is to detect mimic in no more than <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">five</span> stages.</p>",
