    "statement": " The boy Vitya loves to listen to music very much. He knows that $$$n$$$ albums are due to be released this Friday, $$$i$$$-th of which contains $$$k_i$$$ tracks. Of course, Vitya has already listened to all the tracks, and knows that in the $$$i$$$-th album, the coolness of the $$$j$$$-th track is equal to $$$a_{i,j}$$$.<p>Vitya has a friend Masha, whom he really wants to invite to the festival, where his favorite bands perform. However, in order for a friend to agree, she must first evaluate the released novelties. Vitya knows that if Masha listens to a track that was cooler than all the previous ones, she will get 1 unit of impression. Unfortunately, albums can only be listened to in their entirety, without changing the songs in them in places.</p><p>Help Vitya find such an order of albums so that Masha's impression turns out to be as much as possible, and she definitely went to the festival with him. </p>",
