    "statement": "<p>When Darth Vader gets bored, he sits down on the sofa, closes his eyes and thinks of an infinite rooted tree where each node has exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> sons, at that for each node, the distance between it an its <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th left child equals to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. The Sith Lord loves counting the number of nodes in the tree that are at a distance at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> from the root. The distance is the sum of the lengths of edges on the path between nodes.</p><p>But he has got used to this activity and even grew bored of it. 'Why does he do that, then?' \u2014 you may ask. It's just that he feels superior knowing that only he can solve this problem. </p><p>Do you want to challenge Darth Vader himself? Count the required number of nodes.
