She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red planet.</p><p>Let's define $$$x$$$ as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know $$$x$$$. But it is known that $$$1 \\le x \\le m$$$, where Natasha knows the number $$$m$$$. Besides, $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ are positive integers.</p><p>Natasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an integer $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le y \\le m$$$). The correct answer to the question is $$$-1$$$, if $$$x&lt;y$$$, $$$0$$$, if $$$x=y$$$, and $$$1$$$, if $$$x&gt;y$$$. But the rocket is broken\u00a0\u2014 it does not always answer correctly. Precisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal to $$$t$$$, then, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will answer $$$t$$$, otherwise it will answer $$$-t$$$.</p><p>In addition, the rocket has a sequence $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each element of the sequence is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order, that is $$$1$$$-st element, $$$2$$$-nd, $$$3$$$-rd, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$(n-1)$$$-th, $$$n$$$-th, $$$1$$$-st, $$$2$$$-nd, $$$3$$$-rd, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$(n-1)$$$-th, $$$n$$$-th, $$$\\ldots$$$. If the current element is $$$1$$$, the rocket answers correctly, if $$$0$$$\u00a0\u2014 lies. Natasha doesn't know the sequence $$$p$$$, but she knows its length\u00a0\u2014 $$$n$$$.</p><p>You can ask the rocket no more than $$$60$$$ questions.</p><p>Help Natasha find the distance to Mars. Assume, that the distance to Mars does not change while Natasha is asking questions.</p><p>Your solution will not be accepted, if it does not receive an answer $$$0$$$ from the rocket (even if the distance to Mars is uniquely determined by the already received rocket's answers).</p>",
