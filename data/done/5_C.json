For example, sequences \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(())()</span>\u00bb, \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()</span>\u00bb and \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(()(()))</span>\u00bb are regular, while \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)(</span>\u00bb, \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(()</span>\u00bb and \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(()))(</span>\u00bb are not. </p><p>You are given a string of \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(</span>\u00bb and \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)</span>\u00bb characters.
