To guess $$$n$$$, Hayato can only do operations of one kind: choose an integer $$$x$$$ and subtract it from $$$n$$$. Note that after each operation, the number $$$n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">changes</span>. Kira doesn't like bad requests, so if Hayato tries to subtract a number $$$x$$$ greater than $$$n$$$, he will lose to Kira. After each operation, Kira gives Hayato the updated value $$$\\mathrm{cnt}$$$ \u2014 the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the updated value of $$$n$$$.</p><p>Kira doesn't have much patience, so Hayato must guess the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">original</span> value of $$$n$$$ after no more than $$$30$$$ operations.</p><p>Since Hayato is in elementary school, he asks for your help. Write a program that guesses the number $$$n$$$. Kira is an honest person, so he chooses the initial number $$$n$$$ before all operations and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">does not</span> change it afterward.</p>",

For $$$13$$$ the number of unit bits is $$$3$$$, because $$$13_{10} = 1101_2$$$.</p><p>In the first test case, $$$n = 1$$$, so the input is the number $$$1$$$. After subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes zero, so the number of unit bits in it is $$$0$$$.</p><p>In the third test case, $$$n = 3$$$, which in binary representation looks like $$$3_{10} = 11_2$$$, so the input is the number of ones, that is $$$2$$$. After subtracting $$$2$$$, $$$n = 1$$$, so the number of unit bits is now $$$1$$$. After subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes equal to zero.</p><p>Note that the blank lines in the input and output examples are shown for clarity and are not present in the actual interaction.</p>",
