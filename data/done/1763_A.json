Consider that there are an infinite number of leading zero bits at the beginning of any binary representation.</p><p>For example, swap the $$$0$$$-th bit for $$$4=100_2$$$ and $$$3=11_2$$$ will result $$$101_2=5$$$ and $$$10_2=2$$$.

The array now becomes $$$a = [1, 0, 3, 4, 7]$$$. It can be shown that any further operations do not lead to a better answer \u2014 therefore the answer is $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7$$$.</p>",
