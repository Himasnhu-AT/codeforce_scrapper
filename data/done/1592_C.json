As a reminder, a tree on $$$n$$$ nodes is a connected graph with $$$n-1$$$ edges.</p><p>You want to delete <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least $$$1$$$, but at most $$$k-1$$$ edges</span> from the tree, so that the following condition would hold:</p><ul><li><p>For every connected component calculate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR</a> of the values of the nodes in it. Then, these values have to be the same for all connected components.</p></li></ul><p>Is it possible to achieve this condition?</p>",
