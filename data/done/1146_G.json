The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.</p><p>In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you can gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.</p><p>The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions though. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that if the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ is strictly more than $$$x_i$$$, you must pay a fine of $$$c_i$$$.</p><p>You would like to build houses to maximize your profit (sum of dollars gained minus fines). Determine the maximum profit possible.</p>",

We don't violate any restrictions, so there are no fees, so the total profit is $$$14 - 0 = 14$$$.</p><p>In the second example, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 8, 10]$$$. We get a gain of $$$10^2+8^2+8^2+10^2 = 328$$$, and we violate the second restriction for a fee of $$$39$$$, thus the total profit is $$$328-39 = 289$$$. Note that even though there isn't a restriction on building $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$.</p>",
