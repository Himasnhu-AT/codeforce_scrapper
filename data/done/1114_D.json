In other words, all squares on the segment from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ should have the same color.</p><p>For example, the line $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$ has $$$1$$$ connected component, while the line $$$[5, 2, 4, 4]$$$ has $$$3$$$ connected components.</p><p>The game \"flood fill\" is played on the given line as follows: </p><ul> <li> At the start of the game you pick any starting square (this is not counted as a turn). </li><li> Then, in each game turn, change the color of the connected component containing the starting square to any other color. </li></ul><p>Find the minimum number of turns needed for the entire line to be changed into a single color.</p>",
