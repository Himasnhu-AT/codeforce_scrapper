    "statement": "<p>Monocarp is playing a MMORPG. There are two commonly used types of currency in this MMORPG \u2014 gold coins and silver coins. Monocarp wants to buy a new weapon for his character, and that weapon costs $$$n$$$ silver coins. Unfortunately, right now, Monocarp has no coins at all.</p><p>Monocarp can earn gold coins by completing quests in the game. Each quest yields exactly one gold coin. Monocarp can also exchange coins via the in-game trading system. Monocarp has spent days analyzing the in-game economy; he came to the following conclusion: it is possible to sell one gold coin for $$$a$$$ silver coins (i.\u2009e. Monocarp can lose one gold coin to gain $$$a$$$ silver coins), or buy one gold coin for $$$b$$$ silver coins (i.\u2009e. Monocarp can lose $$$b$$$ silver coins to gain one gold coin).</p><p>Now Monocarp wants to calculate the minimum number of quests that he has to complete in order to have at least $$$n$$$ silver coins after some abuse of the in-game economy. Note that Monocarp can perform exchanges of both types (selling and buying gold coins for silver coins) any number of times.</p>",
