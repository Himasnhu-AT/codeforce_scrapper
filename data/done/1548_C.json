    "statement": "<p>Three little pigs from all over the world are meeting for a convention! Every minute, a triple of 3 new pigs arrives on the convention floor. After the $$$n$$$-th minute, the convention ends.</p><p>The big bad wolf has learned about this convention, and he has an attack plan. At some minute in the convention, he will arrive and eat exactly $$$x$$$ pigs. Then he will get away.</p><p>The wolf wants Gregor to help him figure out the number of possible attack plans that involve eating exactly $$$x$$$ pigs for various values of $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 3n$$$). Two attack plans are considered different, if they occur at different times or if the sets of little pigs to eat are different.</p><p>Note that all queries are independent, that is, the wolf does not eat the little pigs, he only makes plans!</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \\le q \\le 2\\cdot 10^5$$$), the number of minutes the convention lasts and the number of queries the wolf asks.</p><p>Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 3n$$$), the number of pigs the wolf will eat in the $$$i$$$-th query.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>You should print $$$q$$$ lines, with line $$$i$$$ representing the number of attack plans if the wolf wants to eat $$$x_i$$$ pigs. Since each query answer can be large, output each answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>",

There are three queries: $$$x=1$$$, $$$x=5$$$, and $$$x=6$$$.</p><p>If the wolf wants to eat $$$1$$$ pig, he can do so in $$$3+6=9$$$ possible attack plans, depending on whether he arrives at minute $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$.</p><p>If the wolf wants to eat $$$5$$$ pigs, the wolf cannot arrive at minute $$$1$$$, since there aren't enough pigs at that time. Therefore, the wolf has to arrive at minute $$$2$$$, and there are $$$6$$$ possible attack plans.</p><p>If the wolf wants to eat $$$6$$$ pigs, his only plan is to arrive at the end of the convention and devour everybody.</p><p>Remember to output your answers modulo $$$10^9+7$$$!</p>",
