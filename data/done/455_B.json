Now they invent the game with strings for two players.</p><p>Given a group of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.</p><p>Andrew and Alex decided to play this game <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> times. The player who is the loser of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th game makes the first move in the <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>i</i>\u2009+\u20091)</span>-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.</p>",
