    "statement": "<p>Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room\u00a0\u2014 five windows, and a seven-room\u00a0\u2014 seven windows.</p><p>Monocarp went around the building and counted $$$n$$$ windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.</p><p>Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has $$$n$$$ windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul> <li> if Monocarp has counted $$$30$$$ windows, there could have been $$$2$$$ three-room apartments, $$$2$$$ five-room apartments and $$$2$$$ seven-room apartments, since $$$2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 7 = 30$$$; </li><li> if Monocarp has counted $$$67$$$ windows, there could have been $$$7$$$ three-room apartments, $$$5$$$ five-room apartments and $$$3$$$ seven-room apartments, since $$$7 \\cdot 3 + 5 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot 7 = 67$$$; </li><li> if Monocarp has counted $$$4$$$ windows, he should have mistaken since no building with the aforementioned layout can have $$$4$$$ windows. </li></ul>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Th first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of windows in the building.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, if a building with the new layout and the given number of windows just can't exist, print $$$-1$$$.</p><p>Otherwise, print three non-negative integers\u00a0\u2014 the possible number of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p>",
