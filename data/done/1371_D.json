Construct a grid $$$A$$$ with size $$$n \\times n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consisting of integers $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$</span>. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $$$k$$$. In other words, the number of $$$1$$$ in the grid is equal to $$$k$$$.</p><p>Let's define:</p><ul> <li> $$$A_{i,j}$$$ as the integer in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column. </li><li> $$$R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n}$$$ (for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$). </li><li> $$$C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j}$$$ (for all $$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$). </li><li> In other words, $$$R_i$$$ are row sums and $$$C_j$$$ are column sums of the grid $$$A$$$. </li><li> For the grid $$$A$$$ let's define the value $$$f(A) = (\\max(R)-\\min(R))^2 + (\\max(C)-\\min(C))^2$$$ (here for an integer sequence $$$X$$$ we define $$$\\max(X)$$$ as the maximum value in $$$X$$$ and $$$\\min(X)$$$ as the minimum value in $$$X$$$). </li></ul><p>Find any grid $$$A$$$, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value $$$f(A)$$$ is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.</p>",
