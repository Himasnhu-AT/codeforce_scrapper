    "statement": "<p>Misha hacked the Codeforces site. Then he decided to let all the users change their handles. A user can now change his handle any number of times. But each new handle must not be equal to any handle that is already used or that was used at some point.</p><p>Misha has a list of handle change requests. After completing the requests he wants to understand the relation between the original and the new handles of the users. Help him to do that.</p>",

The strings consist of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. Strings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>old</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>new</i></span> are distinct. The lengths of the strings do not exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">20</span>.</p><p>The requests are given chronologically.

Each of them must contain two strings, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>old</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>new</i></span>, separated by a space, meaning that before the user had handle <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>old</i></span>, and after all the requests are completed, his handle is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>new</i></span>.
