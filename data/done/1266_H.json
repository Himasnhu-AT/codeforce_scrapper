    "statement": "<p>There is a directed graph on $$$n$$$ vertices numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$ where each vertex (except $$$n$$$) has two outgoing arcs, red and blue. At any point in time, exactly one of the arcs is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">active</span> for each vertex. Initially, all blue arcs are active and there is a token located at vertex $$$1$$$. In one second, the vertex with token first switches its active arcs \u2014 the inactive arc becomes active and vice versa. Then, the token is moved along the active arc. When the token reaches the vertex $$$n$$$, it stops. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is reachable via arcs from every vertex.</p><p>You are given $$$q$$$ queries. Each query contains a state of the graph \u2014 a pair $$$(v, s)$$$ of the following form: </p><ul> <li> $$$v$$$ is the vertex where the token is currently located; </li><li> $$$s$$$ is a string consisting of $$$n - 1$$$ characters. The $$$i$$$-th character corresponds to the color of the active edge leading from the $$$i$$$-th vertex (the character is '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>' if red arc is active, otherwise the character is '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>'). </li></ul><p>For each query, determine whether the given state is reachable from the initial state and the first time this configuration appears. Note that the two operations (change active arc and traverse it) are atomic \u2014 a state is not considered reached if it appears after changing the active arc but before traversing it.</p>",
