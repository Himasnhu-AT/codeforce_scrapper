    "statement": "<p>Recently Pashmak has been employed in a transportation company. The company has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> buses and has a contract with a school which has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> students. The school planned to take the students to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> different places for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> days (each day in one place). Each day the company provides all the buses for the trip. Pashmak has to arrange the students in the buses. He wants to arrange the students in a way that no two students become close friends. In his ridiculous idea, two students will become close friends if and only if they are in the same buses for all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> days.</p><p>Please help Pashmak with his weird idea. Assume that each bus has an unlimited capacity.</p>",
