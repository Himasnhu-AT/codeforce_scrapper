To simplify the situation he depicted it as a string consisting of zeroes and ones. A zero corresponds to players of one team; a one corresponds to players of another team. If there are at least <span class=\"tex-span\">7</span> players of some team standing one after another, then the situation is considered dangerous. For example, the situation <span class=\"tex-span\">00100110111111101</span> is dangerous and <span class=\"tex-span\">11110111011101</span> is not. You are given the current situation. Determine whether it is dangerous or not.</p>",
