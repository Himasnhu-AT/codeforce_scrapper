The maze is described by $$$n$$$ walls. Each wall can be either circular or straight. <ul> <li> Circular walls are described by a radius $$$r$$$, the distance from the center, and two angles $$$\\theta_1, \\theta_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall in the clockwise direction. Notice that swapping the two angles changes the wall. </li><li> Straight walls are described by an angle $$$\\theta$$$, the direction of the wall, and two radii $$$r_1 &lt; r_2$$$ describing the beginning and the end of the wall. </li></ul><p>Angles are measured in degrees; the angle $$$0$$$ corresponds to the upward pointing direction; and angles increase clockwise (hence the east direction corresponds to the angle $$$90$$$).</p>",
