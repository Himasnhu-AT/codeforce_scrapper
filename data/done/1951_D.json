Today, although Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$ jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most $$$60$$$ stalls (each containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each stall to be an integer number of coins between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^{18}$$$.</p><p>Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall $$$1$$$, buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall $$$2$$$, buy as many jewels as possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that Alice buys exactly $$$k$$$ jewels.
