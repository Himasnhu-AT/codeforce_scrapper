You have to reverse it \u2014 that is, the first letter should become equal to the last letter before the reversal, the second letter should become equal to the second-to-last letter before the reversal \u2014 and so on. For example, if your goal is to reverse the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abddea</span>\", you should get the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aeddba</span>\". To accomplish your goal, you can swap the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">neighboring elements of the string</span>. </p><p>Your task is to calculate the minimum number of swaps you have to perform to reverse the given string.</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example, you have to swap the third and the fourth elements, so the string becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aazaa</span>\". Then you have to swap the second and the third elements, so the string becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">azaaa</span>\". So, it is possible to reverse the string in two swaps.</p><p>Since the string in the second example is a palindrome, you don't have to do anything to reverse it.</p>",
