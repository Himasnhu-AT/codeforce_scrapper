The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">variety</span> of a set of dishes is equal to the number of different dishes in it. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">less</span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">variety</span> is, the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">better</span>.</p><p>In order to reduce the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">variety</span>, a taster was invited. He will eat <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$m_i$$$ grams of food from each dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he will eat exactly $$$m_i$$$ grams of the $$$i$$$-th dish in total.</p><p>Determine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">variety</span> is the minimum possible. If there are several correct answers, you may output any of them.</p>",
