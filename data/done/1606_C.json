For example, if the denominations of banknotes used in Berland are $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$ and $$$100$$$, then $$$f(59) = 14$$$: $$$9$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$5$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$10$$$ burles can be used to represent exactly $$$9 \\cdot 1 + 5 \\cdot 10 = 59$$$ burles, and there's no way to do it with fewer banknotes.</p><p>For a given integer $$$k$$$, find the minimum positive number of burles $$$s$$$ that cannot be represented with $$$k$$$ or fewer banknotes (that is, $$$f(s) &gt; k$$$).</p>",
