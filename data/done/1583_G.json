Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.</p><p>Initially, the time is $$$0$$$. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:</p><ul><li><p>For each $$$k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, Okabe will realize at time $$$b_k$$$ that he was supposed to complete the $$$k$$$-th task at time $$$a_k$$$ ($$$a_k &lt; b_k$$$). </p></li><li><p>When he realizes this, if $$$k$$$-th task was already completed at time $$$a_k$$$, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time $$$a_k$$$ then immediately completes the task.</p></li><li><p>If Okabe time travels to time $$$a_k$$$, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every $$$j$$$, if $$$a_j&gt;a_k$$$, the $$$j$$$-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).</p></li><li><p>Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time $$$a_k$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">only immediately after</span> getting to time $$$b_k$$$ and learning that he was supposed to complete the $$$k$$$-th task at time $$$a_k$$$. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform $$$k$$$-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time $$$b_k$$$ again.</p></li></ul><p>Please refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.</p><p>There is a certain set $$$s$$$ of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in $$$s$$$ are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. It can be proven that eventually all $$$n$$$ tasks will be completed and so the answer always exists.</p>",
