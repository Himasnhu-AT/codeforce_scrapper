Denote the color of the $$$i$$$-th position of the first tape as $$$ca_i$$$, and the color of the $$$i$$$-th position of the second tape as $$$cb_i$$$.</p><p>Now Tokitsukaze wants to select each color an integer value from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, distinct for all the colors. After that she will put down the color values in each colored position on the tapes. Denote the number of the $$$i$$$-th position of the first tape as $$$numa_i$$$, and the number of the $$$i$$$-th position of the second tape as $$$numb_i$$$.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c43e6f42a4cd7b8a218983155bef73e1fb7807c9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>For example, for the above picture, assuming that the color red has value $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x \\leq n$$$), it appears at the $$$1$$$-st position of the first tape and the $$$3$$$-rd position of the second tape, so $$$numa_1=numb_3=x$$$.</p><p>Note that each color $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ should have a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> value, and the same color which appears in both tapes has the same value. </p><p>After labeling each color, the beauty of the two tapes is calculated as $$$$$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|numa_i-numb_i|.$$$$$$</p><p>Please help Tokitsukaze to find the highest possible beauty. </p>",
