    "statement": "<p>Rudolph invented the game of tic-tac-toe for three players. It has classic rules, except for the third player who plays with pluses. Rudolf has a $$$3 \\times 3$$$ field \u00a0\u2014 the result of the completed game. Each field cell contains either a cross, or a nought, or a plus sign, or nothing. The game is won by the player who makes a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of $$$3$$$'s of their symbols.</p><p>Rudolph wants to find the result of the game. Either exactly one of the three players won or it ended in a draw. It is guaranteed that multiple players cannot win at the same time.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of three lines, each of which consists of three characters. The symbol can be one of four: \"X\" means a cross, \"O\" means a nought, \"+\" means a plus, \".\" means an empty cell.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print the string \"X\" if the crosses won, \"O\" if the noughts won, \"+\" if the pluses won, \"DRAW\" if there was a draw.</p>",
