    "statement": "<p>Long ago, Vasily built a good fence at his country house. Vasily calls a fence <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">good</span>, if it is a series of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> consecutively fastened vertical boards of centimeter width, the height of each in centimeters is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">a positive integer</span>. The house owner remembers that the height of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th board to the left is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>.</p><p>Today Vasily decided to change the design of the fence he had built, by cutting his top connected part so that the fence remained good. The cut part should consist of only the upper parts of the boards, while the adjacent parts must be interconnected (share a non-zero length before cutting out of the fence).</p><p>You, as Vasily's curious neighbor, will count the number of possible ways to cut exactly one part as is described above. Two ways to cut a part are called distinct, if for the remaining fences there is such <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>, that the height of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th boards vary.</p><p>As Vasily's fence can be very high and long, get the remainder after dividing the required number of ways by <span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009000\u2009000\u2009007</span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097)</span>.</p>",
