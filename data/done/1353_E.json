    "statement": "<p>You are given a garland consisting of $$$n$$$ lamps. States of the lamps are represented by the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character of the string $$$s_i$$$ equals '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>' if the $$$i$$$-th lamp is turned off or '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>' if the $$$i$$$-th lamp is turned on. You are also given a positive integer $$$k$$$.</p><p>In one move, you can choose <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one lamp</span> and change its state (i.e. turn it on if it is turned off and vice versa).</p><p>The garland is called $$$k$$$-periodic if the distance between <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">each pair of adjacent turned on lamps</span> is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$. Consider the case $$$k=3$$$. Then garlands \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00010010</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1001001</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00010</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\" are good but garlands \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00101001</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000001</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01001100</span>\" are not. Note that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the garland is not cyclic</span>, i.e. the first turned on lamp is not going after the last turned on lamp and vice versa.</p><p>Your task is to find the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of moves you need to make to obtain $$$k$$$-periodic garland from the given one.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",
