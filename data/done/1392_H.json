    "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> has a deck of $$$n+m$$$ custom-made cards, which consists of $$$n$$$ cards labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ jokers. Since <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> is lonely, he wants to play a game with himself using those cards. </p><p>Initially, the deck is shuffled uniformly randomly and placed on the table. <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> has a set $$$S$$$ which is initially empty. </p><p>Every second, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> draws the top card from the deck. </p><ul> <li> If the card has a number $$$x$$$ written on it, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> removes the card and adds $$$x$$$ to the set $$$S$$$. </li><li> If the card drawn is a joker, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">zscoder</span> places all the cards back into the deck and reshuffles (uniformly randomly) the $$$n+m$$$ cards to form a new deck (hence the new deck now contains all cards from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and the $$$m$$$ jokers). Then, if $$$S$$$ currently contains all the elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the game ends. Shuffling the deck doesn't take time at all. </li></ul><p>What is the expected number of seconds before the game ends? We can show that the answer can be written in the form $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P, Q$$$ are relatively prime integers and $$$Q \\neq 0 \\bmod 998244353$$$.
