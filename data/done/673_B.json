They are arranged in ascending order by their difficulty, and no two problems have the same difficulty. Moreover, there are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> pairs of similar problems. Authors want to split problems between two division according to the following rules: </p><ul> <li> Problemset of each division should be non-empty. </li><li> Each problem should be used in exactly one division (yes, it is unusual requirement). </li><li> Each problem used in division 1 should be harder than any problem used in division 2. </li><li> If two problems are similar, they should be used in different divisions. </li></ul><p>Your goal is count the number of ways to split problem between two divisions and satisfy all the rules. Two ways to split problems are considered to be different if there is at least one problem that belongs to division 1 in one of them and to division 2 in the other.</p><p>Note, that the relation of similarity <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">is not</span> transitive.
