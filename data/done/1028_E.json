    "statement": "<p>While discussing a proper problem A for a Codeforces Round, Kostya created a cyclic array of positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Since the talk was long and not promising, Kostya created a new cyclic array $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{n}$$$ so that $$$b_i = (a_i \\mod a_{i + 1})$$$, where we take $$$a_{n+1} = a_1$$$. Here $$$mod$$$ is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation\">modulo operation</a>. When the talk became interesting, Kostya completely forgot how array $$$a$$$ had looked like. Suddenly, he thought that restoring array $$$a$$$ from array $$$b$$$ would be an interesting problem (unfortunately, not A).</p>",

All $$$a_i$$$ should satisfy $$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}$$$.
