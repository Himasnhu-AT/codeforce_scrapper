    "statement": "<p>Gildong has bought a famous painting software <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">cfpaint</span>. The working screen of cfpaint is square-shaped consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns of square cells. The rows are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, from left to right. The position of a cell at row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ is represented as $$$(r, c)$$$. There are only two colors for the cells in cfpaint \u2014 black and white.</p><p>There is a tool named <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">eraser</span> in cfpaint. The eraser has an integer size $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n$$$). To use the eraser, Gildong needs to click on a cell $$$(i, j)$$$ where $$$1 \\le i, j \\le n - k + 1$$$. When a cell $$$(i, j)$$$ is clicked, all of the cells $$$(i', j')$$$ where $$$i \\le i' \\le i + k - 1$$$ and $$$j \\le j' \\le j + k - 1$$$ become white. In other words, a square with side equal to $$$k$$$ cells and top left corner at $$$(i, j)$$$ is colored white.</p><p>A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">white line</span> is a row or a column without any black cells.</p><p>Gildong has worked with cfpaint for some time, so some of the cells (possibly zero or all) are currently black. He wants to know the maximum number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">white lines</span> after using the eraser <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly once</span>. Help Gildong find the answer to his question.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns, and the size of the eraser.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters each without spaces. The $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-th line represents the cell at $$$(i,j)$$$. Each character is given as either '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>' representing a black cell, or '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span>' representing a white cell.</p>",
