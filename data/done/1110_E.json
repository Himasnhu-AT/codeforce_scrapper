The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">charge</span> of the $$$i$$$-th stone is equal to $$$c_i$$$.</p><p>Sometimes Grigory gets bored and selects some <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">inner</span> stone (that is, some stone with index $$$i$$$, where $$$2 \\le i \\le n - 1$$$), and after that <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">synchronizes</span> it with neighboring stones. After that, the chosen stone loses its own charge, but acquires the charges from neighboring stones. In other words, its charge $$$c_i$$$ changes to $$$c_i' = c_{i + 1} + c_{i - 1} - c_i$$$.</p><p>Andrew, Grigory's friend, also has $$$n$$$ stones with charges $$$t_i$$$. Grigory is curious, whether there exists a sequence of zero or more <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">synchronization</span> operations, which transforms charges of Grigory's stones into charges of corresponding Andrew's stones, that is, changes $$$c_i$$$ into $$$t_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$?</p>",
