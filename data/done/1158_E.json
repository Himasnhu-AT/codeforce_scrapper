He found a strange device and wants to know how it works.</p><p>This device encrypted with the tree (connected undirected graph without cycles) with $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. To solve this quiz you should guess this tree.</p><p>Fortunately, this device can make one operation, using which you should guess the cipher. You can give the device an array $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n$$$ of non-negative integers. On the device, there are $$$n$$$ lamps, $$$i$$$-th of them is connected with $$$i$$$-th vertex of the tree. For all $$$i$$$ the light will turn on the $$$i$$$-th lamp, if there exist such vertex of the tree with number $$$j \\neq i$$$ that $$$dist(i, j) \\leq d_j$$$. Let's define $$$dist(i, j)$$$ as the distance between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ in tree or number of edges on the simple path between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$.</p><p>Vasya wants to solve this quiz using $$$\\leq 80$$$ operations with the device and guess the tree.
