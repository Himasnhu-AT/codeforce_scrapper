    "statement": "<p>During a New Year special offer the \"Sudislavl Bars\" offered <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> promo codes. Each promo code consists of exactly six digits and gives right to one free cocktail at the bar \"Mosquito Shelter\". Of course, all the promocodes differ.</p><p>As the \"Mosquito Shelter\" opens only at 9, and partying in Sudislavl usually begins at as early as 6, many problems may arise as to how to type a promotional code without errors. It is necessary to calculate such maximum <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>, that the promotional code could be uniquely identified if it was typed with no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> errors. At that, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009=\u20090</span> means that the promotional codes must be entered exactly.</p><p>A mistake in this problem should be considered as entering the wrong numbers. For example, value \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">123465</span>\" contains two errors relative to promocode \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">123456</span>\". Regardless of the number of errors the entered value consists of exactly six digits.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the output contains number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u20091000</span>)\u00a0\u2014 the number of promocodes.</p><p>Each of the next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contains a single promocode, consisting of exactly 6 digits. It is guaranteed that all the promocodes are distinct. Promocodes can start from digit \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\".</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print the maximum <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> (naturally, not exceeding the length of the promocode), such that any promocode can be uniquely identified if it is typed with at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> mistakes.</p>",
