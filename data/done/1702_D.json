    "statement": "<p>Let $$$s$$$ be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of the indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it. For example, the price of the string <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abca</span> is $$$1+2+3+1=7$$$.</p><p>The string $$$w$$$ and the integer $$$p$$$ are given. Remove the minimal number of letters from $$$w$$$ so that its price becomes less than or equal to $$$p$$$ and print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty. You can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the price of a given string $$$w$$$ is less than or equal to $$$p$$$, then nothing needs to be deleted and $$$w$$$ must be output.</p><p>Note that when you delete a letter from $$$w$$$, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For example, if you delete the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">e</span> from the string <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">test</span>, you get <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">tst</span>.</p>",
