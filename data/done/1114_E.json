For example, the list $$$[14, 24, 9, 19]$$$ satisfies this requirement, after sorting it makes a list $$$[9, 14, 19, 24]$$$, which can be produced as $$$x_n = 9 + 5 \\cdot (n - 1)$$$.</p><p>Also you are also given a device, which has a quite discharged battery, thus you can only use it to perform at most $$$60$$$ queries of following two types:</p><ul><li> Given a value $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$), the device will show the value of the $$$a_i$$$.</li><li> Given a value $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$), the device will return $$$1$$$ if an element with a value strictly greater than $$$x$$$ exists, and it will return $$$0$$$ otherwise.</li></ul><p>Your can use this special device for at most $$$60$$$ queries. Could you please find out the smallest element and the common difference of the sequence? That is, values $$$x_1$$$ and $$$d$$$ in the definition of the arithmetic progression. Note that the array $$$a$$$ is not sorted.</p>",
