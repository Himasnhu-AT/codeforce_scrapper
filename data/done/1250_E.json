    "statement": "<p>The coronation of King Berl XXII is soon! The whole royal family, including $$$n$$$ daughters of Berl XXII, will be present.</p><p>The King has ordered his jeweler to assemble $$$n$$$ beautiful necklaces, so each of the princesses could wear exactly one necklace during the ceremony \u2014 and now these necklaces are finished. Each necklace consists of $$$m$$$ gems attached to a gold chain. There are two types of gems used in the necklaces \u2014 emeralds and sapphires. So, each necklace can be represented by a sequence of $$$m$$$ gems (listed from left to right), and each gem is either an emerald or a sapphire. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th necklace can be represented by a binary string $$$s_i$$$ of length $$$m$$$; if the $$$j$$$-th character of $$$s_i$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>, then the $$$j$$$-th gem in the $$$i$$$-th necklace is an emerald; otherwise, this gem is a sapphire.</p><p>Now, looking at the necklaces, the King is afraid that some of his daughters may envy the other daughters' necklaces. He wants all necklaces to look <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">similar</span>. Two necklaces are considered <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">similar</span> if there are at least $$$k$$$ positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems.</p><p>For example, if there is a necklace represented by a sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01010111</span> and a necklace represented by a sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01100000</span>, then there are $$$3$$$ positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems (both first gems are emeralds, both second gems are sapphires, and both fifth gems are emeralds). So if $$$k = 3$$$, these necklaces are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">similar</span>, and if $$$k = 4$$$, they are not <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">similar</span>.</p><p>The King thinks that if two of his daughters notice that their necklaces are not <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">similar</span>, then they may have a conflict \u2014 and, obviously, he doesn't want any conflicts during the coronation! So Berl XXII wants to tell some of his daughters to wear their necklaces backward. If a necklace is worn backward, then the sequence of gems in this necklace is reversed. For example, if a necklace is represented by a sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01100</span>, then, if worn backward, it would be represented by a sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00110</span>. The King wants to find the minimum number of necklaces to be worn backward during the coronation so that there are no conflicts.</p><p>Berl XXII is too busy with preparation for the coronation, so he ordered you to resolve this issue for him. Help him \u2014 and he will give you a truly royal reward! </p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.
