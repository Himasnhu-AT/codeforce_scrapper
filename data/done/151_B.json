    "statement": "<p>Winters are just damn freezing cold in Nvodsk! That's why a group of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> friends prefers to take a taxi, order a pizza and call girls. The phone numbers in the city consist of three pairs of digits (for example, 12-34-56). Each friend has a phonebook of size <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (that's the number of phone numbers). We know that taxi numbers consist of six identical digits (for example, 22-22-22), the numbers of pizza deliveries should necessarily be decreasing sequences of six different digits (for example, 98-73-21), all other numbers are the girls' numbers.</p><p>You are given your friends' phone books. Calculate which friend is best to go to when you are interested in each of those things (who has maximal number of phone numbers of each type). </p><p>If the phone book of one person contains some number two times, you should count it <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">twice</span>. That is, each number should be taken into consideration the number of times it occurs in the phone book.</p>",

Next <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> lines contain numbers as \"XX-XX-XX\", where X is arbitrary digits from <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span>.</p>",

Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of pizza phone numbers. </p><p>In the third line print the phrase \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">If you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: </span>\". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of girls' phone numbers. </p><p>Print the names in the order in which <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">they are given in the input data</span>. Separate two consecutive names with a comma and a space. Each line should end with exactly one point. For clarifications concerning the output form, see sample tests.
