    "statement": "<p>Heidi's friend Jenny is asking Heidi to deliver an important letter to one of their common friends. Since Jenny is Irish, Heidi thinks that this might be a prank. More precisely, she suspects that the message she is asked to deliver states: \"Send the fool further!\", and upon reading it the recipient will ask Heidi to deliver the same message to yet another friend (that the recipient has in common with Heidi), and so on.</p><p>Heidi believes that her friends want to avoid awkward situations, so she will not be made to visit the same person (including Jenny) twice. She also knows how much it costs to travel between any two of her friends who know each other. She wants to know: what is the maximal amount of money she will waste on travel if it really is a prank?</p><p>Heidi's <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> friends are labeled <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> through <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>, and their network of connections forms a tree. In other words, every two of her friends <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> know each other, possibly indirectly (there is a sequence of friends starting from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and ending on <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> and such that each two consecutive friends in the sequence know each other directly), and there are exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> pairs of friends who know each other directly.</p><p>Jenny is given the number <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>.</p>",
