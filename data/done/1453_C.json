    "statement": "<p>Gildong has a square board consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns of square cells, each consisting of a single digit (from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$). The cell at the $$$j$$$-th column of the $$$i$$$-th row can be represented as $$$(i, j)$$$, and the length of the side of each cell is $$$1$$$. Gildong likes big things, so for each digit $$$d$$$, he wants to find a triangle such that:</p><ul> <li> Each vertex of the triangle is in the center of a cell. </li><li> The digit of every vertex of the triangle is $$$d$$$. </li><li> At least one side of the triangle is parallel to one of the sides of the board. You may assume that a side of length $$$0$$$ is parallel to both sides of the board. </li><li> The area of the triangle is maximized. </li></ul><p>Of course, he can't just be happy with finding these triangles as is. Therefore, for each digit $$$d$$$, he's going to change the digit of exactly one cell of the board to $$$d$$$, then find such a triangle. He changes it back to its original digit after he is done with each digit. Find the maximum area of the triangle he can make for each digit.</p><p>Note that he can put multiple vertices of the triangle on the same cell, and the triangle can be a <a href=\"https://cutt.ly/NhbjZ2l\">degenerate triangle</a>; i.e. the area of the triangle can be $$$0$$$. Also, note that he is allowed to change the digit of a cell from $$$d$$$ to $$$d$$$.</p>",

The $$$j$$$-th digit of the $$$i$$$-th line is the digit of the cell at $$$(i, j)$$$.

Since we should print it multiplied by $$$2$$$, the answer for $$$d=0$$$ is $$$4$$$.</p><p>For $$$d=1$$$, Gildong can change the digit of the cell at $$$(1, 3)$$$ into $$$1$$$, making a triangle with vertices on all three $$$1$$$'s that has an area of $$$2$$$.</p><p>For $$$d=2$$$, Gildong can change the digit of one of the following six cells into $$$2$$$ to make a triangle with an area of $$$\\cfrac{1}{2}$$$: $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(3, 1)$$$, $$$(3, 2)$$$, and $$$(3, 3)$$$.</p><p>For the remaining digits (from $$$3$$$ to $$$9$$$), the cell Gildong chooses to change will be the only cell that contains that digit. Therefore the triangle will always be a degenerate triangle with an area of $$$0$$$.</p><p>In the third case, for $$$d=4$$$, note that the triangle will be bigger than the answer if Gildong changes the digit of the cell at $$$(1, 4)$$$ and use it along with the cells at $$$(2, 1)$$$ and $$$(4, 3)$$$, but this is invalid because it violates the condition that at least one side of the triangle must be parallel to one of the sides of the board.</p>",
