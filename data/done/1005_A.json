    "statement": "<p>Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $$$1$$$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $$$3$$$ steps, and the second contains $$$4$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4$$$.</p><p>You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.</p><p>The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.</p>",

Passing a stairway with $$$x$$$ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $$$1, 2, \\dots, x$$$ in that order.</p><p>The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.</p>",
