    "statement": "<p>Josuke received a huge undirected weighted complete$$$^\\dagger$$$ graph $$$G$$$ as a gift from his grandfather. The graph contains $$$10^{18}$$$ vertices. The peculiarity of the gift is that the weight of the edge between the different vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is equal to $$$\\gcd(u, v)^\\ddagger$$$. Josuke decided to experiment and make a new graph $$$G'$$$. To do this, he chooses two integers $$$l \\le r$$$ and deletes all vertices except such vertices $$$v$$$ that $$$l \\le v \\le r$$$, and also deletes all the edges except between the remaining vertices.</p><p>Now Josuke is wondering how many different weights are there in $$$G'$$$. Since their count turned out to be huge, he asks for your help.</p><p>$$$^\\dagger$$$ A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent.</p><p>$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor\">greatest common divisor (GCD)</a> of the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.</p>",
