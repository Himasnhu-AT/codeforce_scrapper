The doors are placed one after another, however, possibly in a different order. To proceed to the next door, the knight must first open the door before.</p><p>Each door can be only opened with a key of the corresponding color. So three keys: a red key, a green key and a blue key\u00a0\u2014 are also placed somewhere in the hallway. To open the door, the knight should first pick up the key of its color.</p><p>The knight has a map of the hallway. It can be transcribed as a string, consisting of six characters: </p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">G</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>\u00a0\u2014 denoting red, green and blue doors, respectively; </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">r</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">g</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\u00a0\u2014 denoting red, green and blue keys, respectively. </li></ul><p>Each of these six characters appears in the string exactly once.</p><p>The knight is standing at the beginning of the hallway\u00a0\u2014 on the left on the map.</p><p>Given a map of the hallway, determine if the knight can open all doors and meet the princess at the end of the hallway.</p>",
