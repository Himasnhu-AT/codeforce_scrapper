    "statement": "<p>Little Tanya decided to present her dad a postcard on his Birthday. She has already created a message \u2014 string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Tanya can't write yet, so she found a newspaper and decided to cut out the letters and glue them into the postcard to achieve string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. The newspaper contains string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. We know that the length of string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> greater or equal to the length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>.</p><p>The newspaper may possibly have too few of some letters needed to make the text and too many of some other letters. That's why Tanya wants to cut some <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> letters out of the newspaper and make a message of length exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, so that it looked as much as possible like <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. If the letter in some position has correct value and correct letter case (in the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and in the string that Tanya will make), then she shouts joyfully \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YAY!</span>\", and if the letter in the given position has only the correct value but it is in the wrong case, then the girl says \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">WHOOPS</span>\".</p><p>Tanya wants to make such message that lets her shout \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YAY!</span>\" as much as possible. If there are multiple ways to do this, then her second priority is to maximize the number of times she says \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">WHOOPS</span>\". Your task is to help Tanya make the message.</p>",
