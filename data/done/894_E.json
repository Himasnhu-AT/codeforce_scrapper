    "statement": "<p>Ralph is going to collect mushrooms in the Mushroom Forest. </p><p>There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> directed paths connecting <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> trees in the Mushroom Forest. On each path grow some mushrooms. When Ralph passes a path, he collects all the mushrooms on the path. The Mushroom Forest has a magical fertile ground where mushrooms grow at a fantastic speed. New mushrooms regrow as soon as Ralph finishes mushroom collection on a path. More specifically, after Ralph passes a path the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th time, there regrow <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> mushrooms less than there was before this pass. That is, if there is initially <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> mushrooms on a path, then Ralph will collect <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> mushrooms for the first time, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> mushrooms the second time, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009-\u20091\u2009-\u20092</span> mushrooms the third time, and so on. However, the number of mushrooms can never be less than <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>.</p><p>For example, let there be <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span> mushrooms on a path initially. The number of mushrooms that can be collected from the path is <span class=\"tex-span\">9</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> when Ralph passes by from first to fourth time. From the fifth time and later Ralph can't collect any mushrooms from the path (but still can pass it).</p><p>Ralph decided to start from the tree <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. How many mushrooms can he collect using only described paths?</p>",
