    "statement": "<p>Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.</p><p>All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $$$1$$$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $$$1$$$ as well. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that both of the statistics update at the same time</span> (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).</p><p>Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.</p><p>So he peeked at the stats $$$n$$$ times and wrote down $$$n$$$ pairs of integers \u2014 $$$(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ is the number of plays at the $$$i$$$-th moment of time and $$$c_i$$$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">The stats are given in chronological order</span> (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).</p><p>Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.</p><p>Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.</p><p>Help him to check the correctness of his records.</p><p>For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ $$$(1 \\le T \\le 500)$$$ \u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$p_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $$$i$$$-th moment of time.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that the stats are given in chronological order.</span></p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case print a single line.</p><p>If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\".</p><p>Otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\".</p><p>You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.</p><p>The second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.</p><p>In the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.</p><p>The fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.</p><p>In the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.</p><p>Nobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.</p>",
