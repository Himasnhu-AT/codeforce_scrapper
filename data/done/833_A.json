After that, the winner's score is multiplied by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup></span>, and the loser's score is multiplied by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>.

She managed to recall the final results for each games, though, but all of her memories of them are vague.
