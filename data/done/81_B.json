    "statement": "<p>Polycarp is very careful. He even types numeric sequences carefully, unlike his classmates. If he sees a sequence without a space after the comma, with two spaces in a row, or when something else does not look neat, he rushes to correct it. For example, number sequence written like \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1,2\u00a0,3,...,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010</span>\" will be corrected to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0...,\u00a010</span>\".</p><p>In this task you are given a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, which is composed by a concatination of terms, each of which may be: </p><ul> <li> a positive integer of an arbitrary length (leading zeroes are not allowed), </li><li> a \"comma\" symbol (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">,</span>\"), </li><li> a \"space\" symbol (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\"> </span>\"), </li><li> \"three dots\" (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">...</span>\", that is, exactly three points written one after another, also known as suspension points). </li></ul><p>Polycarp wants to add and remove spaces in the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> to ensure the following: </p><ul> <li> each comma is followed by exactly one space (if the comma is the last character in the string, this rule does not apply to it), </li><li> each \"three dots\" term is preceded by exactly one space (if the dots are at the beginning of the string, this rule does not apply to the term), </li><li> if two consecutive numbers were separated by spaces only (one or more), then exactly one of them should be left, </li><li> there should not be other spaces. </li></ul><p>Automate Polycarp's work and write a program that will process the given string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The input data contains a single string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. Its length is from 1 to 255 characters. The string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> does not begin and end with a space. Its content matches the description given above.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> after it is processed. Your program's output should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">exactly</span> the same as the expected answer. It is permissible to end output line with a line-break character, and without it.</p>",
