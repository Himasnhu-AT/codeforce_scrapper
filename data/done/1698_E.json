    "statement": "<p>You are given a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Recall that permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order.</p><p>You have a strength of $$$s$$$ and perform $$$n$$$ moves on the permutation $$$a$$$. The $$$i$$$-th move consists of the following: </p><ul> <li> Pick two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$i \\leq x \\leq y \\leq \\min(i+s,n)$$$, and swap the positions of the integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in the permutation $$$a$$$. Note that you <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">can</span> select $$$x=y$$$ in the operation, in which case no swap will occur. </li></ul><p>You want to turn $$$a$$$ into another permutation $$$b$$$ after $$$n$$$ moves. However, some elements of $$$b$$$ are missing and are replaced with $$$-1$$$ instead. Count the number of ways to replace each $$$-1$$$ in $$$b$$$ with some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ so that $$$b$$$ is a permutation and it is possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ with a strength of $$$s$$$. </p><p>Since the answer can be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",

We can make $$$a$$$ into $$$[3,1,2]$$$ with a strength of $$$1$$$ as follows: $$$$$$[2,1,3] \\xrightarrow[x=1,\\,y=1]{} [2,1,3] \\xrightarrow[x=2,\\,y=3]{} [3,1,2] \\xrightarrow[x=3,\\,y=3]{} [3,1,2].$$$$$$ It can be proven that it is impossible to make $$$[2,1,3]$$$ into $$$[3,2,1]$$$ with a strength of $$$1$$$. Thus only one permutation $$$b$$$ satisfies the constraints, so the answer is $$$1$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ the same as the previous test case, but we now have a strength of $$$2$$$. We can make $$$a$$$ into $$$[3,2,1]$$$ with a strength of $$$2$$$ as follows: $$$$$$[2,1,3] \\xrightarrow[x=1,\\,y=3]{} [2,3,1] \\xrightarrow[x=2,\\,y=3]{} [3,2,1] \\xrightarrow[x=3,\\,y=3]{} [3,2,1].$$$$$$ We can still make $$$a$$$ into $$$[3,1,2]$$$ using a strength of $$$1$$$ as shown in the previous test case, so the answer is $$$2$$$. </p><p>In the third test case, there is only one permutation $$$b$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, so the answer is $$$0$$$.</p>",
