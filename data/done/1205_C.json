Rows are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from up to down, columns are enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. Cell, standing on the intersection of row $$$x$$$ and column $$$y$$$, is denoted by $$$(x, y)$$$.</p><p>Every cell contains $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. It is known that the top-left cell contains $$$1$$$, and the bottom-right cell contains $$$0$$$.</p><p>We want to know numbers in all cells of the grid. To do so we can ask the following questions: </p><p>\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">$$$?$$$ $$$x_1$$$ $$$y_1$$$ $$$x_2$$$ $$$y_2$$$</span>\", where $$$1 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le n$$$, and $$$x_1 + y_1 + 2 \\le x_2 + y_2$$$. In other words, we output two different cells $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$, $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ of the grid such that we can get from the first to the second by moving only to the right and down, and they aren't adjacent.</p><p>As a response to such question you will be told if there exists a path between $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$, going only to the right or down, numbers in cells of which form a palindrome.</p><p>For example, paths, shown in green, are palindromic, so answer for \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">$$$?$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">$$$?$$$ $$$1$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$3$$$ $$$3$$$</span>\" would be that there exists such path. However, there is no palindromic path between $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(3, 1)$$$.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ced4b1f37f0db8117da3c34a0c9eaf1c38426458.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Determine all cells of the grid by asking not more than $$$n^2$$$ questions.
