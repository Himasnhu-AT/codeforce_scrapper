Soroush agreed to be the host and will provide money for the winner's prize, and Mashtali became the Front Man!</p><p>$$$m$$$ players registered to play in the games to win the great prize, but when Mashtali found out how huge the winner's prize is going to be, he decided to <span class=\"tex-font-style-striked\">kill</span> eliminate all the players so he could take the money for himself!</p><p>Here is how evil Mashtali is going to eliminate players:</p><p>There is an unrooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. Every player has $$$2$$$ special vertices $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$.</p><p>In one operation, Mashtali can choose any vertex $$$v$$$ of the tree. Then, for each remaining player $$$i$$$ he finds a vertex $$$w$$$ on the simple path from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$, which is the closest to $$$v$$$. If $$$w\\ne x_i$$$ and $$$w\\ne y_i$$$, player $$$i$$$ will be eliminated.</p><p>Now Mashtali wondered: \"What is the minimum number of operations I should perform so that I can remove every player from the game and take the money for myself?\"</p><p>Since he was only thinking about the money, he couldn't solve the problem by himself and asked for your help!</p>",
