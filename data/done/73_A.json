    "statement": "<p>Vasya plays The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. Oh, those creators of computer games! What they do not come up with! Absolutely unique monsters have been added to the The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. One of these monsters is Unkillable Slug. Why it is \"Unkillable\"? Firstly, because it can be killed with cutting weapon only, so lovers of two-handed amber hammers should find suitable knife themselves. Secondly, it is necessary to make so many cutting strokes to Unkillable Slug. Extremely many. Too many! </p><p>Vasya has already promoted his character to 80-th level and in order to gain level 81 he was asked to kill Unkillable Slug. The monster has a very interesting shape. It looks like a rectangular parallelepiped with size <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>y</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>z</i></span>, consisting of undestructable cells <span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091</span>. At one stroke Vasya can cut the Slug along an imaginary grid, i.e. cut with a plane parallel to one of the parallelepiped side. Monster dies when amount of parts it is divided reaches some critical value.</p><p>All parts of monster do not fall after each cut, they remains exactly on its places. I. e. Vasya can cut several parts with one cut.</p><p>Vasya wants to know what the maximum number of pieces he can cut the Unkillable Slug into striking him at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> times.</p><p>Vasya's character uses absolutely thin sword with infinite length.</p>",
