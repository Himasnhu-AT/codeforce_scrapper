    "statement": "<p>You are given a set of $$$n$$$ segments on the axis $$$Ox$$$, each segment has integer endpoints between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$$$) \u2014 coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints. </p><p>Consider all integer points between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point $$$x$$$ belongs to the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ if and only if $$$l \\le x \\le r$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le m$$$) \u2014 the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that $$$l_i=r_i$$$, i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>In the first line print one integer $$$k$$$ \u2014 the number of points that don't belong to any segment.</p><p>In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ integers in <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">any</span> order \u2014 the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.</p><p>If there are no such points at all, print a single integer $$$0$$$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.</p>",
