    "statement": "<p>Furik and Rubik love playing computer games. Furik has recently found a new game that greatly interested Rubik. The game consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> parts and to complete each part a player may probably need to complete some other ones. We know that the game can be fully completed, that is, its parts do not form cyclic dependencies. </p><p>Rubik has <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> computers, on which he can play this game. All computers are located in different houses. Besides, it has turned out that each part of the game can be completed only on one of these computers. Let's number the computers with integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>. Rubik can perform the following actions: </p><ul> <li> Complete some part of the game on some computer. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> hour on completing any part on any computer. </li><li> Move from the 1-st computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> hour on that. </li><li> Move from the 1-st computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> hours on that. </li><li> Move from the 2-nd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> hours on that. </li><li> Move from the 2-nd computer to the 3-rd one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> hour on that. </li><li> Move from the 3-rd computer to the 1-st one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> hour on that. </li><li> Move from the 3-rd computer to the 2-nd one. Rubik spends exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> hours on that. </li></ul><p>Help Rubik to find the minimum number of hours he will need to complete all parts of the game. Initially Rubik can be located at the computer he considers necessary. </p>",
