    "statement": "<p>Raj has a single physical network line that connects his office to the Internet. This line bandwidth is $$$b$$$ bytes per millisecond.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ users who would like to use this network line to transmit some data. The $$$i$$$-th of them will use the line from millisecond $$$s_i$$$ to millisecond $$$f_i$$$ inclusive. His initial data rate will be set to $$$d_i$$$. That means he will use data rate equal to $$$d_i$$$ for millisecond $$$s_i$$$, and then it will change according to the procedure described below.</p><p>The flow control will happen as follows. Suppose there are $$$m$$$ users trying to transmit some data via the given network line during millisecond $$$x$$$. Denote as $$$t_i$$$ the data rate that the $$$i$$$-th of these $$$m$$$ users has at the beginning of this millisecond. All $$$t_i$$$ are non-negative integer values. </p><ol> <li> If $$$m = 0$$$, i.\u00a0e. there are no users trying to transmit data during this millisecond, nothing happens. </li><li> If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is less than or equal to $$$b$$$, each active user successfully completes his transmission (the $$$i$$$-th active user transmits $$$t_i$$$ bytes). After that, the data rate of each active user grows by $$$1$$$, i.\u00a0e. each $$$t_i$$$ is increased by $$$1$$$. </li><li> If the sum of all $$$t_i$$$ is greater than $$$b$$$, the congestion occurs and no data transmissions succeed this millisecond at all. If that happens, each $$$t_i$$$ decreases twice, i.\u00a0e. each $$$t_i$$$ is replaced with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{t_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$. </li></ol><p>Raj knows all the values $$$n$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$, and $$$d_i$$$, he wants to calculate the total number of bytes transmitted by all the users in the aggregate.</p>",
