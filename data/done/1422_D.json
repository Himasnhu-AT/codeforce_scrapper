To do this, Yura can use the instant-movement locations around the city.</p><p>Let's represent the city as an area of $$$n \\times n$$$ square blocks. Yura needs to move from the block with coordinates $$$(s_x,s_y)$$$ to the block with coordinates $$$(f_x,f_y)$$$. In one minute Yura can move to any neighboring by side block; in other words, he can move in four directions. Also, there are $$$m$$$ instant-movement locations in the city. Their coordinates are known to you and Yura. Yura can move to an instant-movement location in no time if he is located in a block with the same coordinate $$$x$$$ or with the same coordinate $$$y$$$ as the location.</p><p>Help Yura to find the smallest time needed to get home.</p>",
