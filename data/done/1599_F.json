There are $$$10^9+7$$$ cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once and Q queries that you need to answer. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from $$$L_{i}$$$ to $$$R_{i}$$$ on that list using only roads of length $$$D_{i}$$$. </p>",

Next Q lines contain three integers $$$L, R$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq L_{i}, R_{i} \\leq N$$$, $$$0 \\leq D_{i} \\leq 10^9+6$$$) \u2014 the range of cities that needs to be connected and the length of the road that you can use. </p>",
