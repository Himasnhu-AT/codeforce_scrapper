    "statement": "<p>One of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal $$$s$$$ towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response $$$t$$$ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $$$t$$$ is similar to $$$s$$$.</p><p>The original signal $$$s$$$ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $$$t$$$, however, does not look as easy as $$$s$$$, but the scientists don't give up! They represented $$$t$$$ as a sequence of English letters and say that $$$t$$$ is similar to $$$s$$$ if you can replace all zeros in $$$s$$$ with some string $$$r_0$$$ and all ones in $$$s$$$ with some other string $$$r_1$$$ and obtain $$$t$$$. The strings $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$ must be different and non-empty.</p><p>Please help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $$$r_0$$$ and $$$r_1$$$) that transform $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.</p>",
