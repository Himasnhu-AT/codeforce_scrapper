    "statement": "<p>Piglet has got a birthday today. His friend Winnie the Pooh wants to make the best present for him \u2014 a honey pot. Of course Winnie realizes that he won't manage to get the full pot to Piglet. In fact, he is likely to eat all the honey from the pot. And as soon as Winnie planned a snack on is way, the pot should initially have as much honey as possible. </p><p>The day before Winnie the Pooh replenished his honey stocks. Winnie-the-Pooh has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> shelves at home, each shelf contains some, perhaps zero number of honey pots. During the day Winnie came to the honey shelves <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i></span> times; on the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th time he came to some shelf <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, took from it some pots <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, tasted the honey from each pot and put all those pots on some shelf <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. As Winnie chose the pots, he followed his intuition. And that means that among all sets of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> pots on shelf <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, he equiprobably chooses one.</p><p>Now Winnie remembers all actions he performed with the honey pots. He wants to take to the party the pot he didn't try the day before. For that he must know the mathematical expectation of the number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> of shelves that don't have a single <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">untasted pot</span>. To evaluate his chances better, Winnie-the-Pooh wants to know the value <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> after each action he performs.</p><p>Your task is to write a program that will find those values for him.</p>",
