The answer is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" as you can choose the path to the vertex $$$u=9$$$ so vertices $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ both have distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$1$$$ which belongs to this path and the vertex $$$8$$$ has distance $$$1$$$ to the vertex $$$7$$$ which belongs to this path.</p><p>The fifth and the sixth queries both have answer \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" because you cannot choose suitable vertex $$$u$$$.</p>",
