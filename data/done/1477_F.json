    "statement": "<p>Nezzar buys his favorite snack\u00a0\u2014 $$$n$$$ chocolate bars with lengths $$$l_1,l_2,\\ldots,l_n$$$. However, chocolate bars might be too long to store them properly! </p><p>In order to solve this problem, Nezzar designs an interesting process to divide them into small pieces. Firstly, Nezzar puts all his chocolate bars into a black box. Then, he will perform the following operation repeatedly until the maximum length over all chocolate bars does not exceed $$$k$$$.</p><ul> <li> Nezzar picks a chocolate bar from the box with probability proportional to its length $$$x$$$. </li><li> After step $$$1$$$, Nezzar uniformly picks a real number $$$r \\in (0,x)$$$ and divides the chosen chocolate bar into two chocolate bars with lengths $$$r$$$ and $$$x-r$$$. </li><li> Lastly, he puts those two new chocolate bars into the black box. </li></ul><p>Nezzar now wonders, what is the expected number of operations he will perform to divide his chocolate bars into small pieces.</p><p>It can be shown that the answer can be represented as $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \\not \\equiv 0$$$ ($$$\\bmod 998\\,244\\,353$$$). Print the value of $$$P\\cdot Q^{-1} \\mod 998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
