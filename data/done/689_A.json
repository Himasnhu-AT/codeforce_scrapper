The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys, located in the following way:</p><center> <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5c60ed3976147c1c90119a9ead7181e750377a9b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Together with his old phone, he lost all his contacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put some number in. One can formally consider <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">finger movements</span> as a sequence of vectors connecting centers of keys pressed consecutively to put in a number. For example, the finger movements for number \"586\" are the same as finger movements for number \"253\":</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f8bba884cc9711e5074cb8cad1f1828e2772acaa.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/0b8353002f648d51e4c4c34c207ce27d61b95e15.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Mike has already put in a number by his \"finger memory\" and started calling it, so he is now worrying, can he be sure that he is calling the correct number? In other words, is there any other number, that has the same finger movements?</p>",
