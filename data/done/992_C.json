    "statement": "<p>Nastya received a gift on New Year\u00a0\u2014 a magic wardrobe. It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles (i.e. the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the month).</p><p>Unfortunately, right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses (if any) with the <span class=\"tex-span\">50%</span> probability. It happens every month except the last one in the year. </p><p>Nastya owns <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> dresses now, so she became interested in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\">expected number</a> of dresses she will have in one year. Nastya lives in Byteland, so the year lasts for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009+\u20091</span> months.</p><p>Nastya is really busy, so she wants you to solve this problem. You are the programmer, after all. Also, you should find the answer modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097</span>, because it is easy to see that it is always integer.</p>",
