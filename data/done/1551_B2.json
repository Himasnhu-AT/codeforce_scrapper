    "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">This problem is an extension of the problem \"Wonderful Coloring - 1\". It has quite many differences, so you should read this statement completely.</span></p><p>Recently, Paul and Mary have found a new favorite sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. They want to paint it using pieces of chalk of $$$k$$$ colors. The coloring of a sequence is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">wonderful</span> if the following conditions are met:</p><ol> <li> each element of the sequence is either painted in one of $$$k$$$ colors or isn't painted; </li><li> each two elements which are painted in the same color are different (i.\u2009e. there's no two equal values painted in the same color); </li><li> let's calculate for each of $$$k$$$ colors the number of elements painted in the color \u2014 all calculated numbers must be equal; </li><li> the total number of painted elements of the sequence is the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> among all colorings of the sequence which meet the first three conditions. </li></ol><p>E.\u2009g. consider a sequence $$$a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2]$$$ and $$$k=3$$$. One of the wonderful colorings of the sequence is shown in the figure.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b2117ab8e16470ba572bc56a594d8c701e3f6378.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The example of a wonderful coloring of the sequence $$$a=[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 3, 10, 10, 2]$$$ and $$$k=3$$$.

The second one contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
