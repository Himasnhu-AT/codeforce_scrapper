GSKR (Gensokyo Railways) consists of $$$n$$$ stations with $$$m$$$ bidirectional tracks connecting them. The $$$i$$$-th track has length $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1\\le l_i\\le 10^6$$$). Due to budget limits, the railway system <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">may not be connected</span>, though there may be more than one track between two stations.</p><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">value</span> of a railway system is defined as the total length of its all tracks. The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">maximum (or minimum) capacity</span> of a railway system is defined as the maximum (or minimum) value among all of the currently functional system's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree#Spanning_forests\">full spanning forest</a>.</p><p>In brief, full spanning forest of a graph is a spanning forest with the same connectivity as the given graph.</p><p>Kanako has a simulator only able to process no more than $$$2m$$$ queries. The input of the simulator is a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting of characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> and/or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>.

In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.</p>",
