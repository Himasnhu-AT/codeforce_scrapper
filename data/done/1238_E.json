Every character of this string is one of the first $$$m$$$ lowercase Latin letters.</p><p>Since you spend a lot of time typing it, you want to buy a new keyboard.</p><p>A keyboard is a permutation of the first $$$m$$$ Latin letters. For example, if $$$m = 3$$$, then there are six possible keyboards: <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">acb</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bac</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bca</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cab</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cba</span>.</p><p>Since you type your password with one finger, you need to spend time moving your finger from one password character to the next. The time to move from character $$$s_i$$$ to character $$$s_{i+1}$$$ is equal to the distance between these characters on keyboard. The total time you have to spend typing the password with a keyboard is called the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">slowness</span> of this keyboard.</p><p>More formaly, the slowness of keyboard is equal to $$$\\sum\\limits_{i=2}^{n} |pos_{s_{i-1}} - pos_{s_i} |$$$, where $$$pos_x$$$ is position of letter $$$x$$$ in keyboard.</p><p>For example, if $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aacabc</span> and the keyboard is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bac</span>, then the total time of typing this password is $$$|pos_a - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_c| + |pos_c - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_b| + |pos_b - pos_c|$$$ = $$$|2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 3|$$$ = $$$0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5$$$.</p><p>Before buying a new keyboard you want to know the minimum possible slowness that the keyboard can have. </p>",
