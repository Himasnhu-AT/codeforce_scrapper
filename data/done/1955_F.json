    "statement": "<p>Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, each integer of the sequence <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">doesn't exceed $$$4$$$</span>. The rules of the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning condition \u2014 Alice wins if the <a href=\"http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng\">bitwise XOR</a> of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.</p><p>The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with $$$n$$$ numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with $$$n-1$$$ numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with $$$n - 2$$$ numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty.</p><p>Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains four integers $$$p_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le p_i \\le 200$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game.</p>",
