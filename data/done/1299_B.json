Define $$$P(x,y)$$$ as a polygon obtained by translating $$$P$$$ by vector $$$\\overrightarrow {(x,y)}$$$. The picture below depicts an example of the translation:</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/d246cb11d75dc41d29514f13749060e3e7489a6d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>Define $$$T$$$ as a set of points which is the union of all $$$P(x,y)$$$ such that the origin $$$(0,0)$$$ lies in $$$P(x,y)$$$ (both strictly inside and on the boundary). There is also an equivalent definition: a point $$$(x,y)$$$ lies in $$$T$$$ only if there are two points $$$A,B$$$ in $$$P$$$ such that $$$\\overrightarrow {AB} = \\overrightarrow {(x,y)}$$$. One can prove $$$T$$$ is a polygon too. For example, if $$$P$$$ is a regular triangle then $$$T$$$ is a regular hexagon. At the picture below $$$P$$$ is drawn in black and some $$$P(x,y)$$$ which contain the origin are drawn in colored: </p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7d436ef63c19a91784777ebd99af84d0235368.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">The spaceship has the best aerodynamic performance if $$$P$$$ and $$$T$$$ are similar.</span> Your task is to check whether the polygons $$$P$$$ and $$$T$$$ are <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/vp5m7vl\">similar</a>.</p>",
