    "statement": "<p>Once Petya read a problem about a bracket sequence. He gave it much thought but didn't find a solution. Today you will face it.</p><p>You are given string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. It represents a correct bracket sequence. A correct bracket sequence is the sequence of opening (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(</span>\") and closing (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)</span>\") brackets, such that it is possible to obtain a correct mathematical expression from it, inserting numbers and operators between the brackets. For example, such sequences as \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(())()</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()</span>\" are correct bracket sequences and such sequences as \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)()</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(()</span>\" are not.</p><p>In a correct bracket sequence each bracket corresponds to the matching bracket (an opening bracket corresponds to the matching closing bracket and vice versa). For example, in a bracket sequence shown of the figure below, the third bracket corresponds to the matching sixth one and the fifth bracket corresponds to the fourth one.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/70c346398bf9216308f72c833c2888c69b8c1062.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center> <p>You are allowed to color some brackets in the bracket sequence so as all three conditions are fulfilled: </p><ul> <li> Each bracket is either not colored any color, or is colored red, or is colored blue. </li><li> For any pair of matching brackets exactly one of them is colored. In other words, for any bracket the following is true: either it or the matching bracket that corresponds to it is colored. </li><li> No two neighboring colored brackets have the same color. </li></ul><p>Find the number of different ways to color the bracket sequence. The ways should meet the above-given conditions. Two ways of coloring are considered different if they differ in the color of at least one bracket. As the result can be quite large, print it modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">1000000007</span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097</span>).</p>",
