    "statement": "<p>Timofey has an apple tree growing in his garden; it is a rooted tree of $$$n$$$ vertices with the root in vertex $$$1$$$ (the vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$). A tree is a connected graph without loops and multiple edges.</p><p>This tree is very unusual\u00a0\u2014 it grows with its root upwards. However, it's quite normal for programmer's trees.</p><p>The apple tree is quite young, so only two apples will grow on it. Apples will grow in certain vertices (these vertices may be the same). After the apples grow, Timofey starts shaking the apple tree until the apples fall. Each time Timofey shakes the apple tree, the following happens to each of the apples:</p><p>Let the apple now be at vertex $$$u$$$.</p><ul> <li> If a vertex $$$u$$$ has a child, the apple moves to it (if there are several such vertices, the apple can move to any of them). </li><li> Otherwise, the apple falls from the tree. </li></ul><p>It can be shown that after a finite time, both apples will fall from the tree.</p><p>Timofey has $$$q$$$ assumptions in which vertices apples can grow. He assumes that apples can grow in vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and wants to know the number of pairs of vertices ($$$a$$$, $$$b$$$) from which apples can fall from the tree, where $$$a$$$\u00a0\u2014 the vertex from which an apple from vertex $$$x$$$ will fall, $$$b$$$\u00a0\u2014 the vertex from which an apple from vertex $$$y$$$ will fall. Help him do this.</p>",
