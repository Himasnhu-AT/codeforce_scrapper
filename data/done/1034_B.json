He loves all things about it.</p><p>Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $$$n \\times m$$$. The cell in the $$$x$$$-th row and in the $$$y$$$-th column is called $$$(x,y)$$$. Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $$$3$$$. The Manhattan distance between two cells $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$ and $$$(x_j,y_j)$$$ is defined as $$$|x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j|$$$.</p><p>He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard.
