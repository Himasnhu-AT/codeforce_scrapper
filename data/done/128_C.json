Initially they have a checkered piece of paper with a painted <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> rectangle (only the border, no filling). Anna and Maria move in turns and Anna starts. During each move one should paint inside the last-painted rectangle a new lesser rectangle (along the grid lines). The new rectangle should have no common points with the previous one. Note that when we paint a rectangle, we always paint only the border, the rectangles aren't filled.</p><p>Nobody wins the game \u2014 Anna and Maria simply play until they have done <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> moves in total.
