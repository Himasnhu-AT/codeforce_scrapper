    "statement": "<p>Shakespeare is a widely known esoteric programming language in which programs look like plays by Shakespeare, and numbers are given by combinations of ornate epithets. In this problem we will have a closer look at the way the numbers are described in Shakespeare.</p><p>Each constant in Shakespeare is created from non-negative powers of 2 using arithmetic operations. For simplicity we'll allow only addition and subtraction and will look for a representation of the given number which requires a minimal number of operations.</p><p>You are given an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. You have to represent it as <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>\u2009+\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>\u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>m</i></sub></span>, where each of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> is a non-negative power of 2, possibly multiplied by -1. Find a representation which minimizes the value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The only line of input contains a positive integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, written as its binary notation. The length of the notation is at most <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">6</sup></span>. The first digit of the notation is guaranteed to be 1.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output the required minimal <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>. After it output <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> lines. Each line has to be formatted as \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+2^x</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-2^x</span>\", where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> is the power coefficient of the corresponding term.
