He has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and he decided to keep doing the following operation on it: </p><ul> <li> he picks $$$2$$$ adjacent elements; he then removes them and places a single integer in their place: their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR</a>. Note that the length of the array decreases by one. </li></ul><p>Now he asks you if he can make all elements of the array equal. Since babies like to make your life harder, he requires that you leave at least $$$2$$$ elements remaining.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 15$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases you need to solve.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integers $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i &lt; 2^{30}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.</p>",
