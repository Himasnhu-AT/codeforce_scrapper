Then, each unit of time, they can each independently move one unit in either direction across the number line, or <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not move at all</span>. </li><li> If $$$c &gt; 0$$$, it means that $$$c$$$ more <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">blue</span> pandas check position $$$x$$$ for red pandas at time $$$t$$$. If a blue panda does not meet a red panda at that specific location and time, they dejectedly leave the number line right away.
