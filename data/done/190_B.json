    "statement": "<p>So, the Berland is at war with its eternal enemy Flatland again, and Vasya, an accountant, was assigned to fulfil his duty to the nation. </p><p>Right now the situation in Berland is dismal \u2014 their both cities are surrounded! The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly in the direction of the city \u2014 that's the strategy the flatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities.</p><p>The berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance of at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span>). Then the radar can immediately inform about the enemy's attack. </p><p>Due to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection radius <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>)</span> is, the more the radar costs.</p><p>That's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090)</span> such, that a radar with radius <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> can be installed at some point and it can register <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the start of the movements</span> of both flatland rings from that point. </p><p>In this problem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range \u2014 as a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar is placed.</p>",
