    "statement": "<p>Monocarp is the most famous thief in Berland. This time, he decided to steal two diamonds. Unfortunately for Monocarp, there are $$$n$$$ cameras monitoring the diamonds. Each camera has two parameters, $$$t_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$. The first parameter determines whether the camera is monitoring the first diamond only ($$$t_i=1$$$), the second diamond only ($$$t_i=2$$$), or both diamonds ($$$t_i=3$$$). The second parameter determines the number of seconds the camera will be disabled after it is hacked.</p><p>Every second, Monocarp can perform one of the following three actions: </p><ul> <li> do nothing; </li><li> choose a camera and hack it; if Monocarp hacks the $$$i$$$-th camera, it will be disabled for the next $$$s_i$$$ seconds (if the current second is the $$$T$$$-th one, the camera will be disabled from the $$$(T+1)$$$-th to the $$$(T+s_i)$$$-th second, inclusive); </li><li> steal a diamond if all cameras monitoring it are currently disabled. Monocarp cannot steal the second diamond if he hasn't stolen the first diamond yet. </li></ul><p>Note that Monocarp can hack a camera multiple times, even if it is currently disabled.</p><p>Your task is to determine the minimum time it will take Monocarp to steal both diamonds, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">beginning with the first diamond</span>, or report that it is impossible.</p>",
