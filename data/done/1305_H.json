    "statement": "<p>As a professional private tutor, Kuroni has to gather statistics of an exam. Kuroni has appointed you to complete this important task. You must not disappoint him.</p><p>The exam consists of $$$n$$$ questions, and $$$m$$$ students have taken the exam. Each question was worth $$$1$$$ point. Question $$$i$$$ was solved by at least $$$l_i$$$ and at most $$$r_i$$$ students. Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is $$$t$$$.</p><p>Furthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, where rank $$$1$$$ has the highest score and rank $$$m$$$ has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.</p><p>You know that the student at rank $$$p_i$$$ had a score of $$$s_i$$$ for $$$1 \\le i \\le q$$$.</p><p>You wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place. Help Kuroni determine the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains two integers ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^{5}$$$), denoting the number of questions of the exam and the number of students respectively.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each, with the $$$i$$$-th line containing $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\le l_{i} \\le r_{i} \\le m$$$).</p><p>The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \\le q \\le m$$$). </p><p>The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers each, denoting $$$p_{i}$$$ and $$$s_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_{i} \\le m$$$, $$$0 \\le s_{i} \\le n$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$p_{i}$$$ are distinct and if $$$p_{i} \\le p_{j}$$$, then $$$s_{i} \\ge s_{j}$$$.</p><p>The last line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$0 \\le t \\le nm$$$), denoting the total score of all students.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output two integers: the maximum number of students who could have gotten as many points as the student with rank $$$1$$$, and the maximum possible score for rank $$$1$$$ achieving this maximum number of students. If there is no valid arrangement that fits the given data, output $$$-1$$$ $$$-1$$$.</p>",

Note that the scores of the students are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ respectively, which satisfies the condition that the student at rank $$$4$$$ gets exactly $$$1$$$ point. Finally, $$$3$$$ students tied for first with a maximum score of $$$2$$$, and it can be proven that we cannot do better with any other arrangement.</p>",
