First, we need to remove both black vertices (2 and 4), then separately remove vertices 1 and 3. We can't remove them together because they end up in different connectivity components after vertex 2 is removed.</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/dd210123a3e88e285161cdcc3db8772feef69c63.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>In the third test case, we can remove vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 at the same time, because three of them are white and one is grey. After that, we can remove vertex 5.</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9bedb72f0162f0217f71da42a1d30f03ae37e9d4.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>In the fourth test case, three operations are enough. One of the ways to solve the problem is to remove all black vertices at once, then remove white vertex 7, and finally, remove connected white vertices 1 and 3.</p>",
