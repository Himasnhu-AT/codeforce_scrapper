    "statement": "<p>A boy named Ayrat lives on planet AMI-1511. Each inhabitant of this planet has a talent. Specifically, Ayrat loves running, moreover, just running is not enough for him. He is dreaming of making running a real art.</p><p>First, he wants to construct the running track with coating <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. On planet AMI-1511 the coating of the track is the sequence of colored blocks, where each block is denoted as the small English letter. Therefore, every coating can be treated as a string.</p><p>Unfortunately, blocks aren't freely sold to non-business customers, but Ayrat found an infinite number of coatings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. Also, he has scissors and glue. Ayrat is going to buy some coatings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, then cut out from each of them <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one continuous piece</span> (substring) and glue it to the end of his track coating. Moreover, he may choose to flip this block before glueing it. Ayrat want's to know the minimum number of coating <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> he needs to buy in order to get the coating <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> for his running track. Of course, he also want's to know some way to achieve the answer.</p>",
