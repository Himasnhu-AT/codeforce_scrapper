The computers are equipped with a security system, so to crack the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th of them, the robot needs to collect at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> any pieces of information from the other computers. Doc can hack the computer only if he is right next to it.</p><p>The robot is assembled using modern technologies and can move along the line of computers in either of the two possible directions, but the change of direction requires a large amount of resources from Doc.
