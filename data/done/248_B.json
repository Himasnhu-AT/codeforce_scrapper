These numbers are <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">7</span>. But Willy grew rather bored of such numbers, so he came up with a few games that were connected with them.</p><p>Chilly Willy wants to find the minimum number of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, such that it is simultaneously divisible by all numbers Willy already knows (<span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">7</span>). Help him with that.</p><p>A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeros.</p>",
