Therefore, for each cell of the chessboard, you can assign the coordinates $$$(r,c)$$$, where $$$r$$$ is the number of the row, and $$$c$$$ is the number of the column.</p><p>The white king has been sitting in a cell with $$$(1,1)$$$ coordinates for a thousand years, while the black king has been sitting in a cell with $$$(n,n)$$$ coordinates. They would have sat like that further, but suddenly a beautiful coin fell on the cell with coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$...</p><p>Each of the monarchs wanted to get it, so they decided to arrange a race according to slightly changed chess rules:</p><p>As in chess, the white king makes the first move, the black king makes the second one, the white king makes the third one, and so on. However, in this problem, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">kings can stand in adjacent cells or even in the same cell at the same time</span>.</p><p>The player who reaches the coin first will win, that is to say, the player who reaches the cell with the coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$ first will win.</p><p>Let's recall that the king is such a chess piece that can move one cell in all directions, that is, if the king is in the $$$(a,b)$$$ cell, then in one move he can move from $$$(a,b)$$$ to the cells $$$(a + 1,b)$$$, $$$(a - 1,b)$$$, $$$(a,b + 1)$$$, $$$(a,b - 1)$$$, $$$(a + 1,b - 1)$$$, $$$(a + 1,b + 1)$$$, $$$(a - 1,b - 1)$$$, or $$$(a - 1,b + 1)$$$.
