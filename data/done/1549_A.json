    "statement": "<p>Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.</p><p>Gregor's favorite <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">prime</span> number is $$$P$$$. Gregor wants to find two <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">bases</span> of $$$P$$$. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ which satisfy both of the following properties.</p><ul> <li> $$$P \\bmod a = P \\bmod b$$$, where $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder when $$$x$$$ is divided by $$$y$$$, and </li><li> $$$2 \\le a &lt; b \\le P$$$. </li></ul><p>Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$).</p><p>Each subsequent line contains the integer $$$P$$$ ($$$5 \\le P \\le {10}^9$$$), with $$$P$$$ guaranteed to be prime.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Your output should consist of $$$t$$$ lines. Each line should consist of two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \\le a &lt; b \\le P$$$). If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.</p>",

    ],
    "note": "<p>The first query is $$$P=17$$$. $$$a=3$$$ and $$$b=5$$$ are valid <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">bases</span> in this case, because $$$17 \\bmod 3 = 17 \\bmod 5 = 2$$$. There are other pairs which work as well.</p><p>In the second query, with $$$P=5$$$, the only solution is $$$a=2$$$ and $$$b=4$$$.</p>",
