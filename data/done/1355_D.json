    "statement": "<p>Petya and Vasya are competing with each other in a new interesting game as they always do.</p><p>At the beginning of the game Petya has to come up with an array of $$$N$$$ positive integers. Sum of all elements in his array should be equal to $$$S$$$. Then Petya has to select an integer $$$K$$$ such that $$$0 \\leq K \\leq S$$$.</p><p>In order to win, Vasya has to find a non-empty subarray in Petya's array such that the sum of all selected elements equals to either $$$K$$$ or $$$S - K$$$. Otherwise Vasya loses.</p><p>You are given integers $$$N$$$ and $$$S$$$. You should determine if Petya can win, considering Vasya plays optimally. If Petya can win, help him to do that.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq S \\leq 10^{6}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the required length of the array and the required sum of its elements.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>If Petya can win, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" (without quotes) in the first line. Then print Petya's array in the second line. The array should contain $$$N$$$ positive integers with sum equal to $$$S$$$. In the third line print $$$K$$$. If there are many correct answers, you can print any of them.</p><p>If Petya can't win, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" (without quotes).</p><p>You can print each letter in any register (lowercase or uppercase).</p>",
