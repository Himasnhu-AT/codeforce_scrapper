Chaneka will choose one or more different indices and colour the elements at those chosen indices black. Then, she will choose all white elements whose indices are multiples of the index of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least one</span> black element and colour those elements green. After that, her score is the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> value of $$$a_i$$$ out of all black and green elements.</p><p>There are $$$2^n-1$$$ ways for Chaneka to choose the black indices. Find the sum of scores for all possible ways Chaneka can choose the black indices. Since the answer can be very big, print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
