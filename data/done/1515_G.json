The $$$i$$$-th car starts at intersection $$$v_i$$$ and has an odometer that begins at $$$s_i$$$, increments for each mile driven, and resets to $$$0$$$ whenever it reaches $$$t_i$$$. Phoenix has been tasked to drive cars along some roads (possibly none) and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">return them to their initial intersection</span> with the odometer showing $$$0$$$.</p><p>For each car, please find if this is possible. </p><p>A car may visit the same road or intersection an arbitrary number of times.
