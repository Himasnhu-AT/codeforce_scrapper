The cost of a path (not necessarily simple) in this graph is defined as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">XOR</a> of weights of all edges in that path with each edge being counted as many times as the path passes through it.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">But the trips with cost $$$0$$$ aren't exciting.</span> </p><p>You may choose any subset of edges incident to the vertex $$$1$$$ and remove them. How many are there such subsets, that, when removed, there is not any nontrivial cycle with the cost equal to $$$0$$$ which passes through the vertex $$$1$$$ in the resulting graph? A cycle is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">nontrivial</span> if it passes through some edge odd number of times. As the answer can be very big, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>",
