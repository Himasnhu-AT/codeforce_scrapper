    "statement": "<p>Nick is interested in prime numbers. Once he read about <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">Goldbach problem</span>. It states that every even integer greater than <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> can be expressed as the sum of two primes. That got Nick's attention and he decided to invent a problem of his own and call it <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">Noldbach problem</span>. Since Nick is interested only in prime numbers, Noldbach problem states that at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> prime numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> inclusively can be expressed as the sum of three integer numbers: two neighboring prime numbers and <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. For example, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">19</span> = <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">7</span> + <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">11</span> + <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>, or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">13</span> = <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">5</span> + <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">7</span> + <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>.</p><p>Two prime numbers are called neighboring if there are no other prime numbers between them.</p><p>You are to help Nick, and find out if he is right or wrong.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> if at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> prime numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> inclusively can be expressed as it was described above.

    "note": "<p>In the first sample the answer is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> since at least two numbers can be expressed as it was described (for example, 13 and 19). In the second sample the answer is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span> since it is impossible to express 7 prime numbers from 2 to 45 in the desired form.</p>",
