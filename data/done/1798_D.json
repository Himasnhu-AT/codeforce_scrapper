It is easy to see that for such an arrangement $$$\\lvert a_l + \\ldots + a_r \\rvert$$$ is always not greater than $$$7$$$, and therefore less than $$$9$$$.</p><p>In the second test case you can rearrange the elements of the array as $$$[-3, 2, -3, 2, 2]$$$. Then the maximum modulus of the sum will be reached on the subarray $$$[-3, 2, -3]$$$, and will be equal to $$$\\lvert -3 + 2 + -3 \\rvert = \\lvert -4 \\rvert = 4$$$, which is less than $$$5$$$.</p><p>In the fourth test example, any rearrangement of the array $$$a$$$ will be suitable as an answer, including $$$[-1, 0, 1]$$$.</p>",
