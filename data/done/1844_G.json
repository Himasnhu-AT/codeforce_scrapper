The $$$i$$$-th edge connects nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ and has an unknown positive integer weight $$$w_i$$$. To help you figure out these weights, you are also given the distance $$$d_i$$$ between the nodes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for all $$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$ (the sum of the weights of the edges on the simple path between the nodes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ in the tree).</p><p>Find the weight of each edge.
