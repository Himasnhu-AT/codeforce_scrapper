    "statement": "<p>Professor Phunsuk Wangdu has performed some experiments on rays. The setup for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> rays is as follows.</p><p>There is a rectangular box having exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> holes on the opposite faces. All rays enter from the holes of the first side and exit from the holes of the other side of the box. Exactly one ray can enter or exit from each hole. The holes are in a straight line.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/28583bedfa0495c0d7b4821b0712ee974a30bb9e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Professor Wangdu is showing his experiment to his students. He shows that there are cases, when all the rays are intersected by every other ray. A curious student asked the professor: \"Sir, there are some groups of rays such that all rays in that group intersect every other ray in that group. Can we determine the number of rays in the largest of such groups?\".</p><p>Professor Wangdu now is in trouble and knowing your intellect he asks you to help him.</p>",

Hence every ray in this group is intersected by each other one. There does not exist any group containing more than 3 rays satisfying the above-mentioned constraint.</p>",
