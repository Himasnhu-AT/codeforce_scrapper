    "statement": "<p>After making a strategic plan with carriers for expansion of mobile network throughout the whole country, the government decided to cover rural areas with the last generation of 5G network.</p><p>Since 5G antenna towers will be built in the area of mainly private properties, the government needs an easy way to find information about landowners for each <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">property</span> partially or fully contained in the planned building area. </p><p>The planned building area is represented as a rectangle with sides $$$width$$$ and $$$height$$$.</p><p>Every 5G antenna tower occupies a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">circle</span> with a center in $$$(x,y)$$$ and radius $$$r$$$. </p><p>There is a database of Geodetic Institute containing information about each property. Each property is defined with its <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">identification number</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">polygon</span> represented as an array of $$$(x,y)$$$ points in the counter-clockwise direction. </p><p>Your task is to build an IT system which can handle queries of type $$$(x, y, r)$$$ in which $$$(x,y)$$$ represents a circle center, while $$$r$$$ represents its radius. The IT system should return the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">total area</span> of properties that need to be acquired for the building of a tower so that the government can estimate the price. Furthermore, the system should return a list of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">identification numbers</span> of these properties (so that the owners can be contacted for land acquisition).</p><p>A property needs to be acquired if the circle of the antenna tower is intersecting or touching it. </p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains the size of the building area as double values $$$width$$$, $$$height$$$, and an integer $$$n$$$ \u2014 the number of properties in the database. </p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of a single property in the form of an integer number $$$v$$$ ($$$3 \\le v \\le 40$$$) \u2014 the number of points that define a property, as well as $$$2*v$$$ double numbers \u2014 the coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$ of each property point. Line $$$i$$$ ($$$0 \\le i \\le n-1$$$) contains the information for property with id $$$i$$$.</p><p>The next line contains an integer $$$q$$$ \u2014 the number of queries. </p><p>Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains double values $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$r$$$ \u2014 the coordinates of an antenna circle center $$$(x, y)$$$ and its radius $$$r$$$.</p><p>$$$1 \\le n * q \\le 10^6$$$</p>",
