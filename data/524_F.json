    "statement": "<p>Polycarpus has a finite sequence of opening and closing brackets. In order not to fall asleep in a lecture, Polycarpus is having fun with his sequence. He is able to perform two operations:</p><ul> <li> adding any bracket in any position (in the beginning, the end, or between any two existing brackets); </li><li> cyclic shift \u2014 moving the last bracket from the end of the sequence to the beginning. </li></ul><p>Polycarpus can apply any number of operations to his sequence and adding a cyclic shift in any order. As a result, he wants to get the correct bracket sequence of the minimum possible length. If there are several such sequences, Polycarpus is interested in the lexicographically smallest one. Help him find such a sequence.</p><p>A<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">correct bracket sequence</span> is a sequence of opening and closing brackets, from which you can get a correct arithmetic expression by adding characters \"1\" and \"+\" . Each opening bracket must correspond to a closed one.
