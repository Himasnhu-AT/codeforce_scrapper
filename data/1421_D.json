She may go from a hexagon to any of its six neighbors you want, but there is a cost associated with each of them. The costs depend only on the direction in which you travel. Going from $$$(0, 0)$$$ to $$$(1, 1)$$$ will take the exact same cost as going from $$$(-2, -1)$$$ to $$$(-1, 0)$$$. The costs are given in the input in the order $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, $$$c_3$$$, $$$c_4$$$, $$$c_5$$$, $$$c_6$$$ as in the picture below.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f778c49279ec09f3860a84b2e467d161ae24b6b5.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Print the smallest cost of a path from the origin which has coordinates $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the given cell.</p>",
