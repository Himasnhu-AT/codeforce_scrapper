    "statement": "<p>Little W and Little P decided to send letters to each other regarding the most important events during a day. There are $$$n$$$ events during a day: at time moment $$$t_i$$$ something happens to the person $$$p_i$$$ ($$$p_i$$$ is either <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">P</span>, denoting Little W and Little P, respectively), so he needs to immediately send a letter to the other person. They can send a letter using one of the two ways:</p><ul> <li> Ask Friendly O to deliver the letter directly. Friendly O takes $$$d$$$ acorns for each letter.</li><li> Leave the letter at Wise R's den. Wise R values free space, so he takes $$$c \\cdot T$$$ acorns for storing a letter for a time segment of length $$$T$$$. The recipient can take a letter from Wise R either when he leaves his own letter at Wise R's den, or at time moment $$$t_{n + 1}$$$, when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea. It is not possible to take a letter from Wise R's den at other time moments. The friends can store as many letters at Wise R's den as they want, paying for each one separately. </li></ul><p>Help the friends determine the minimum possible total cost of sending all letters.</p>",
