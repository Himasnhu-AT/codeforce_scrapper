All $$$a_i$$$ should be distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p><p>After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices $$$(i, j)$$$, you add an edge between them if $$$|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \\le k$$$.</p><p>Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum possible (for the given values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$) number of cliques. Each vertex of the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve the problem \"given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques\"</span>.
