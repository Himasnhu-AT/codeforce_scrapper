As there are exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> houses in Ultimate Thule, Vova wants the city to have exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> pipes, each such pipe should be connected to the water supply. A pipe can be connected to the water supply if there's water flowing out of it. Initially Vova has only one pipe with flowing water. Besides, Vova has several splitters.</p><p>A splitter is a construction that consists of one input (it can be connected to a water pipe) and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> output pipes. When a splitter is connected to a water pipe, water flows from each output pipe. You can assume that the output pipes are ordinary pipes. For example, you can connect water supply to such pipe if there's water flowing out from it. At most one splitter can be connected to any water pipe.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3836a6f09fa9539e05b08c85883dad842f3b75c1.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-script\">The figure shows a <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>-output splitter</span> </center><p>Vova has one splitter of each kind: with <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>, ..., <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> outputs.
