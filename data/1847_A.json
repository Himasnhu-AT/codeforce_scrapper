Unfortunately, $$$n$$$ of the villagers have become suspicious of his ideas. The $$$i$$$-th villager has a suspicion of $$$a_i$$$ on him.

A group with only one villager has a power of $$$0$$$.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Kars</span> wants to break the villagers into exactly $$$k$$$ contiguous subgroups so that the sum of their power is minimized.
