    "statement": "<p>Greg is a beginner bodybuilder. Today the gym coach gave him the training plan. All it had was <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>n</i></sub></span>. These numbers mean that Greg needs to do exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> exercises today. Besides, Greg should repeat the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th in order exercise <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> times.</p><p>Greg now only does three types of exercises: \"chest\" exercises, \"biceps\" exercises and \"back\" exercises. Besides, his training is cyclic, that is, the first exercise he does is a \"chest\" one, the second one is \"biceps\", the third one is \"back\", the fourth one is \"chest\", the fifth one is \"biceps\", and so on to the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>-th exercise.</p><p>Now Greg wonders, which muscle will get the most exercise during his training. We know that the exercise Greg repeats the maximum number of times, trains the corresponding muscle the most. Help Greg, determine which muscle will get the most training.</p>",
