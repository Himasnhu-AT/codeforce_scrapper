All the monsters are in city $$$n$$$. Jellyfish and Asuka are currently in city $$$1$$$ and need to move to city $$$n$$$ to defeat the monsters.</p><p>There are $$$m$$$ roads. The $$$i$$$-th road allows one to travel from city $$$a_i$$$ to city $$$b_i$$$. All the roads are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">directed</span>. That is, one cannot travel from city $$$b_i$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ using the $$$i$$$-th road. Interestingly, all roads satisfy $$$a_i&lt;b_i$$$.</p><p>Driving EVA requires two people to work together. However, Asuka and Jellyfish have not done any training together before.</p><p>Suppose that EVA is currently in city $$$u$$$. Jellyfish and Asuka will both choose an undestroyed road that starts at city $$$u$$$. Suppose Jellyfish and Asuka choose roads that end at cities $$$v_1$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ respectively. If $$$v_1 = v_2$$$, EVA moves to city $$$v_1$$$ successfully. Otherwise, EVA stays in city $$$u$$$ and both roads that they have chosen will be destroyed.</p><p>It is possible that EVA is currently in city $$$u$$$ ($$$u \\neq n$$$) and there are no undestroyed roads that start at city $$$u$$$. In that case, the mission will be a failure. Otherwise, if they reach city $$$n$$$ in the end, the mission is considered a success.</p><p>Every time they choose the roads, Jellyfish knows that Asuka will choose a road randomly. Now, Jellyfish wants to know, if she chooses the roads optimally, what is the maximum probability of the mission being successful.</p>",
