Lee is so grateful for it, so he decided to show Ice Bear his new game called \"Critic\"...</span></p><p>The game is a one versus one game. It has $$$t$$$ rounds, each round has two integers $$$s_i$$$ and $$$e_i$$$ (which are determined and are known before the game begins, $$$s_i$$$ and $$$e_i$$$ may differ from round to round). The integer $$$s_i$$$ is written on the board at the beginning of the corresponding round. </p><p>The players will take turns. Each player will erase the number on the board (let's say it was $$$a$$$) and will choose to write either $$$2 \\cdot a$$$ or $$$a + 1$$$ instead. Whoever writes a number strictly greater than $$$e_i$$$ loses that round and the other one wins that round.</p><p>Now Lee wants to play \"Critic\" against Ice Bear, for each round he has chosen the round's $$$s_i$$$ and $$$e_i$$$ in advance. Lee will start the first round, the loser of each round will start the next round.</p><p>The winner of the last round is the winner of the game, and the loser of the last round is the loser of the game.</p><p>Determine if Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves or not. Also, determine if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves or not.</p>",
