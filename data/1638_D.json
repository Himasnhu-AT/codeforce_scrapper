Cell $$$(i, j)$$$ has color $$$c_{i,j}$$$.</p><p>Near the painting you also found a brush in the shape of a $$$2 \\times 2$$$ square, so the canvas was surely painted in the following way: initially, no cell was painted. Then, the following painting operation has been performed some number of times:</p><ul> <li> Choose two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i &lt; n$$$, $$$1 \\le j &lt; m$$$) and some color $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le nm$$$). </li><li> Paint cells $$$(i, j)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j)$$$, $$$(i, j + 1)$$$, $$$(i + 1, j + 1)$$$ in color $$$k$$$. </li></ul><p>All cells must be painted at least once.
