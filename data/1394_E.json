Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.</p><p>Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/cc58eb001fee58dd9838da6f9968c3d16f18575b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>We can use sequence $$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ of length $$$n=9$$$ to denote it.</p><p>Now Boboniu wants to <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">fold</span> his collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b7784e5ff2cb1e3ba617a45850b2fa12f92ae949.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if $$$a_i$$$ is folded over $$$a_j$$$ ($$$1\\le i,j\\le n$$$), then $$$a_i=a_j$$$ must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.</p><p>A formal definition of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">fold</span> is described in notes.</p><p>According to the picture above, you can <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">fold</span> $$$a$$$ two times. In fact, you can <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">fold</span> $$$a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]$$$ at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is $$$2$$$.</p><p>As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds. </p><p>You're given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i\\le n$$$), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of $$$[a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_i]$$$.</p>",
