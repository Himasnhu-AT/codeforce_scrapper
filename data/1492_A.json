At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool.</p><p>It takes the first swimmer exactly $$$a$$$ minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly $$$b$$$ minutes for the second swimmer and $$$c$$$ minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$2a$$$, $$$3a$$$, ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$2b$$$, $$$3b$$$, ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$2c$$$, $$$3c$$$, ... minutes.</p><p>You came to the left side of the pool exactly $$$p$$$ minutes after they started swimming. Determine how long you have to wait before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.</p>",
