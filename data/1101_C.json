You should divide all segments into two <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">non-empty</span> groups in such way that there is no pair of segments from different groups which have at least one common point, or say that it's impossible to do it. Each segment should belong to exactly one group.</p><p>To optimize testing process you will be given multitest.</p>",

Queries are independent.</p><p>First line of each query contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) \u2014 number of segments. It is guaranteed that $$$\\sum{n}$$$ over all queries does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ per line ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the $$$i$$$-th segment.</p>",
