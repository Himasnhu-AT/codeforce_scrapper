    "statement": "<p>Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b952567ba3e261d77a18b5b9445bc9882737e6b6.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">proper</span> iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i>\u2009&lt;\u2009<i>b</i></span>) and that the fraction is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">irreducible</span> if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>).</p><p>During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button (<span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009+\u2009</span>) instead of division button (<span class=\"tex-span\">\u00f7</span>) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> instead of the expected decimal notation. </p><p>Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b952567ba3e261d77a18b5b9445bc9882737e6b6.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Help Petya deal with this problem.</p><p> </p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output two space-separated positive integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.</p>",
