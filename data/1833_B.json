However, all the values in array $$$b$$$ are mixed up. </p><p>Determine which day was which temperature, if you know that the weather never differs from the forecast by more than $$$k$$$ degrees. In other words, if on day $$$i$$$ the real air temperature was $$$c$$$, then the equality $$$|a_i - c| \\le k$$$ is always true.</p><p>For example, let an array $$$a$$$ = [$$$1, 3, 5, 3, 9$$$] of length $$$n = 5$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$ be given and an array $$$b$$$ = [$$$2, 5, 11, 2, 4$$$]. Then, so that the value of $$$b_i$$$ corresponds to the air temperature on day $$$i$$$, we can rearrange the elements of the array $$$b$$$ so: [$$$2, 2, 5, 4, 11$$$].
