There is a directed edge from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$u+v$$$ if and only if $$$u\\&amp;v=v$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND operation</a>. There are no other edges in the graph.</p><p>Zookeeper has $$$q$$$ queries. In the $$$i$$$-th query she will ask you if she can travel from vertex $$$u_i$$$ to vertex $$$v_i$$$ by going through directed edges.</p>",
