After you watched the amazing film \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\", you came up with the following operation.</p><p>In one operation, you choose $$$n-1$$$ elements of the array and replace each of them with their arithmetic mean (which doesn't have to be an integer). For example, from the array $$$[1, 2, 3, 1]$$$ we can get the array $$$[2, 2, 2, 1]$$$, if we choose the first three elements, or we can get the array $$$[\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}, 3, \\frac{4}{3}]$$$, if we choose all elements except the third.</p><p>Is it possible to make all elements of the array equal by performing a finite number of such operations?</p>",
