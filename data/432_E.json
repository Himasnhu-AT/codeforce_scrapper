More formally:</p><ul> <li> each cell must be painted some color (the colors are marked by uppercase Latin letters); </li><li> we will assume that two cells of the table are connected if they are of the same color and share a side; each connected region of the table must form a square. </li></ul><p>Given <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>, find lexicographically minimum coloring of the table that meets the described properties.</p>",
