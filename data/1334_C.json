Initially, the $$$i$$$-th monster has $$$a_i$$$ health.</p><p>You may shoot the monsters to kill them. Each shot requires exactly one bullet and decreases the health of the targeted monster by $$$1$$$ (deals $$$1$$$ damage to it). Furthermore, when the health of some monster $$$i$$$ becomes $$$0$$$ or less than $$$0$$$, it dies and explodes, dealing $$$b_i$$$ damage to the next monster (monster $$$i + 1$$$, if $$$i &lt; n$$$, or monster $$$1$$$, if $$$i = n$$$). If the next monster is already dead, then nothing happens. If the explosion kills the next monster, it explodes too, damaging the monster after it and possibly triggering another explosion, and so on.</p><p>You have to calculate the minimum number of bullets you have to fire to kill all $$$n$$$ monsters in the circle.</p>",
