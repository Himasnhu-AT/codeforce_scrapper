    "statement": "<p>A permutation is a sequence of integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> containing each number exactly once. For example, <span class=\"tex-span\">(1)</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">(4,\u20093,\u20095,\u20091,\u20092)</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">(3,\u20092,\u20091)</span> are permutations, and <span class=\"tex-span\">(1,\u20091)</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">(4,\u20093,\u20091)</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">(2,\u20093,\u20094)</span> are not. </p><p>There are many tasks on permutations. Today you are going to solve one of them. Let\u2019s imagine that somebody took several permutations (perhaps, with a different number of elements), wrote them down consecutively as one array and then shuffled the resulting array. The task is to restore the initial permutations if it is possible.</p>",

The next line contains the mixed array of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> integers, divided with a single space.
