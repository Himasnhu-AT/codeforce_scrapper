The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">first</span>.</p><p>Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">$$$(0,0)$$$</span>. In one move a player must increase either the $$$x$$$ coordinate or the $$$y$$$ coordinate of the token by <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$k$$$. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance $$$d$$$ from $$$(0,0)$$$.</p><p>In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are $$$(p,q)$$$, then $$$p^2 + q^2 \\leq d^2$$$ must hold.</p><p>The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.</p>",
