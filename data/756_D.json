    "statement": "<p>Julia is conducting an experiment in her lab. She placed several luminescent bacterial colonies in a horizontal testtube. Different types of bacteria can be distinguished by the color of light they emit. Julia marks types of bacteria with small Latin letters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", ..., \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>\".</p><p>The testtube is divided into <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> consecutive regions. Each region is occupied by a single colony of a certain bacteria type at any given moment. Hence, the population of the testtube at any moment can be described by a string of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> Latin characters.</p><p>Sometimes a colony can decide to conquer another colony in one of the adjacent regions. When that happens, the attacked colony is immediately eliminated and replaced by a colony of the same type as the attacking colony, while the attacking colony keeps its type. Note that a colony can only attack its neighbours within the boundaries of the testtube. At any moment, at most one attack can take place.</p><p>For example, consider a testtube with population \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">babb</span>\". There are six options for an attack that may happen next:</p><ul><li> the first colony attacks the second colony (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2192\u20092</span>), the resulting population is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bbbb</span>\";</li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u2192\u20091</span>, the result is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aabb</span>\";</li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u2192\u20093</span>, the result is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">baab</span>\";</li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u2192\u20092</span>, the result is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bbbb</span>\" (note that the result is the same as the first option);</li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u2192\u20094</span> or <span class=\"tex-span\">4\u2009\u2192\u20093</span>, the population does not change.</li></ul><p>The pattern of attacks is rather unpredictable. Julia is now wondering how many different configurations of bacteria in the testtube she can obtain after a sequence of attacks takes place (it is possible that no attacks will happen at all). Since this number can be large, find it modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097</span>.</p>",
