His current rating is $$$r$$$ units.</p><p>Some very rich customers asked him to complete some projects for their companies. To complete the $$$i$$$-th project, Polycarp needs to have at least $$$a_i$$$ units of rating; after he completes this project, his rating will change by $$$b_i$$$ (his rating will increase or decrease by $$$b_i$$$) ($$$b_i$$$ can be positive or negative). Polycarp's rating should not fall below zero because then people won't trust such a low rated freelancer.</p><p>Polycarp can choose the order in which he completes projects. Furthermore, he can even skip some projects altogether.</p><p>To gain more experience (and money, of course) Polycarp wants to choose the subset of projects <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">having maximum possible size</span> and the order in which he will complete them, so he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the maximum possible size of such subset of projects.</p>",
