    "statement": "<p>The popular improv website <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">Interpretation Impetus</span> hosts regular improv contests and maintains a rating of the best performers. However, since improv can often go horribly wrong, the website is notorious for declaring improv contests <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">unrated</span>. It now holds a wager before each improv contest where the participants try to predict whether it will be rated or unrated, and they are now more popular than the improv itself.</p><p>Izzy and $$$n$$$ other participants take part in each wager. First, they each make their prediction, expressed as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span> (\"rated\") or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> (\"unrated\"). Izzy always goes last, so she knows the predictions of the other participants when making her own. Then, the actual competition takes place and it is declared either rated or unrated.</p><p>You need to write a program that will interactively play as Izzy. There will be $$$m$$$ wagers held in 2021, and Izzy's goal is to have at most $$$1.3\\cdot b + 100$$$ wrong predictions after all those wagers, where $$$b$$$ is the <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">smallest</span> number of wrong predictions that any other wager participant will have after all those wagers. </p><p>The number $$$b$$$ is not known in advance. Izzy also knows nothing about the other participants\u00a0\u2014 they might somehow always guess correctly, or their predictions might be correlated. Izzy's predictions, though, do not affect the predictions of the other participants and the decision on the contest being rated or not\u00a0\u2014 in other words, in each test case, your program always receives the same inputs, no matter what it outputs.</p>",
