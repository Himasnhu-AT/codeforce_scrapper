    "statement": "<p>Doremy has an edge-weighted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices whose weights are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">integers</span> between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. She does $$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ experiments on it.</p><p>In each experiment, Doremy chooses vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$j \\leq i$$$ and connects them directly with an edge with weight $$$1$$$. Then, there is exactly one cycle (or self-loop when $$$i=j$$$) in the graph. Doremy defines $$$f(i,j)$$$ as the sum of lengths of shortest paths from every vertex to the cycle.</p><p>Formally, let $$$\\mathrm{dis}_{i,j}(x,y)$$$ be the length of the shortest path between vertex $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ when the edge $$$(i,j)$$$ of weight $$$1$$$ is added, and $$$S_{i,j}$$$ be the set of vertices that are on the cycle when edge $$$(i,j)$$$ is added. Then,</p><p>$$$$$$ f(i,j)=\\sum_{x=1}^{n}\\left(\\min_{y\\in S_{i,j}}\\mathrm{dis}_{i,j}(x,y)\\right). $$$$$$</p><p>Doremy writes down all values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq n$$$, then goes to sleep. However, after waking up, she finds that the tree has gone missing. Fortunately, the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ are still in her notebook, and she knows which $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ they belong to. Given the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$, can you help her restore the tree?</p><p>It is guaranteed that at least one suitable tree exists.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The following $$$n$$$ lines contain a lower-triangular matrix with $$$i$$$ integers on the $$$i$$$-th line; the $$$j$$$-th integer on the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$f(i,j)$$$ ($$$0 \\le f(i,j) \\le 2\\cdot 10^{15}$$$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that there exists a tree whose weights are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$ such that the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ of the tree match those given in the input.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$n-1$$$ lines describing the tree. In the $$$i$$$-th line of the output, output three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le w_i \\le 10^9$$$), representing an edge $$$(u_i,v_i)$$$ whose weight is $$$w_i$$$.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, you may output any.</p><p>All edges must form a tree and all values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ must match those given in the input.</p>",
