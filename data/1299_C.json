The tanks are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.</p><p>You can perform the following operation: choose some subsegment $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1\\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), and redistribute water in tanks $$$l, l+1, \\dots, r$$$ evenly. In other words, replace each of $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$$$ by $$$\\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1}$$$. For example, if for volumes $$$[1, 3, 6, 7]$$$ you choose $$$l = 2, r = 3$$$, new volumes of water will be $$$[1, 4.5, 4.5, 7]$$$. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">You can perform this operation any number of times</span>.</p><p>What is the lexicographically smallest sequence of volumes of water that you can achieve?</p><p>As a reminder:</p><p>A sequence $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$b$$$ of the same length if and only if the following holds: in the first (leftmost) position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the sequence $$$a$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$b$$$.</p>",
