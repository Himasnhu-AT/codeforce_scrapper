    "statement": "<p>Polycarp decided to generate a biome map for his game. A map is a matrix divided into cells $$$1 \\times 1$$$. Each cell of the map must contain one of the available biomes.</p><p>Each biome is defined by two parameters: temperature (an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and humidity (an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$). But not for every temperature/humidity combination, a corresponding biome is available.</p><p>The biome map should be generated according to the following rules:</p><ul> <li> each cell of the map belongs to exactly one biome; </li><li> each available biome has at least one cell on the map; </li><li> if two cells of the map are adjacent by the side and they belong to biomes with parameters ($$$t_1, h_1$$$) and ($$$t_2, h_2$$$), respectively, then the equality $$$|t_1-t_2| + |h_1-h_2| = 1$$$ holds; </li><li> let the number of available biomes be equal to $$$k$$$, then the number of rows and columns of the map (separately) should not exceed $$$k$$$. </li></ul><p>Help Polycarp generate a biome map that meets all the conditions described above (or report that this is impossible).</p>",
