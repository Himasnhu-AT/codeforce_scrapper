No two stars are located at the same position.</p><p>In the evening Noku is going to take a look at the night sky. He would like to find three distinct stars and form a triangle. The triangle must have positive area. In addition, all other stars must lie strictly outside of this triangle. He is having trouble finding the answer and would like your help. Your job is to find the indices of three stars that would form a triangle that satisfies all the conditions. </p><p>It is guaranteed that there is no line such that all stars lie on that line.
