    "statement": "<p>During the research on properties of the greatest common divisor (<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">GCD</span>) of a set of numbers, Ildar, a famous mathematician, introduced a brand new concept of the weakened common divisor (<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">WCD</span>) of a list of pairs of integers.</p><p>For a given list of pairs of integers $$$(a_1, b_1)$$$, $$$(a_2, b_2)$$$, ..., $$$(a_n, b_n)$$$ their <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">WCD</span> is arbitrary integer greater than $$$1$$$, such that it divides at least one element in each pair. WCD may not exist for some lists.</p><p>For example, if the list looks like $$$[(12, 15), (25, 18), (10, 24)]$$$, then their WCD can be equal to $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$ or $$$6$$$ (each of these numbers is strictly greater than $$$1$$$ and divides at least one number in each pair).</p><p>You're currently pursuing your PhD degree under Ildar's mentorship, and that's why this problem was delegated to you. Your task is to calculate <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">WCD</span> efficiently.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">WCD</span> of the set of pairs. </p><p>If there are multiple possible answers, output any; if there is no answer, print $$$-1$$$.</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example the answer is $$$6$$$ since it divides $$$18$$$ from the first pair, $$$24$$$ from the second and $$$12$$$ from the third ones. Note that other valid answers will also be accepted.</p><p>In the second example there are no integers greater than $$$1$$$ satisfying the conditions.</p><p>In the third example one of the possible answers is $$$5$$$. Note that, for example, $$$15$$$ is also allowed, but it's not necessary to maximize the output.</p>",
