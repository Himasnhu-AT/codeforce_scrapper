    "statement": "<p>Petya has come to the math exam and wants to solve as many problems as possible. He prepared and carefully studied the rules by which the exam passes.</p><p>The exam consists of $$$n$$$ problems that can be solved in $$$T$$$ minutes. Thus, the exam begins at time $$$0$$$ and ends at time $$$T$$$. Petya can leave the exam at any integer time from $$$0$$$ to $$$T$$$, inclusive.</p><p>All problems are divided into two types: </p><ul> <li> easy problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $$$a$$$ minutes to solve any easy problem; </li><li> hard problems \u2014 Petya takes exactly $$$b$$$ minutes ($$$b &gt; a$$$) to solve any hard problem. </li></ul><p>Thus, if Petya starts solving an easy problem at time $$$x$$$, then it will be solved at time $$$x+a$$$. Similarly, if at a time $$$x$$$ Petya starts to solve a hard problem, then it will be solved at time $$$x+b$$$.</p><p>For every problem, Petya knows if it is easy or hard. Also, for each problem is determined time $$$t_i$$$ ($$$0 \\le t_i \\le T$$$) at which it will become <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">mandatory</span> (required). If Petya leaves the exam at time $$$s$$$ and there is such a problem $$$i$$$ that $$$t_i \\le s$$$ and he didn't solve it, then he will receive $$$0$$$ points for the whole exam. Otherwise (i.e if he has solved all such problems for which $$$t_i \\le s$$$) he will receive a number of points equal to the number of solved problems. Note that leaving at time $$$s$$$ Petya can have both \"mandatory\" and \"non-mandatory\" problems solved.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=2$$$, $$$T=5$$$, $$$a=2$$$, $$$b=3$$$, the first problem is hard and $$$t_1=3$$$ and the second problem is easy and $$$t_2=2$$$. Then:</p><ul> <li> if he leaves at time $$$s=0$$$, then he will receive $$$0$$$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems; </li><li> if he leaves at time $$$s=1$$$, he will receive $$$0$$$ points since he will not have time to solve any problems; </li><li> if he leaves at time $$$s=2$$$, then he can get a $$$1$$$ point by solving the problem with the number $$$2$$$ (it must be solved in the range from $$$0$$$ to $$$2$$$); </li><li> if he leaves at time $$$s=3$$$, then he will receive $$$0$$$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them; </li><li> if he leaves at time $$$s=4$$$, then he will receive $$$0$$$ points since at this moment both problems will be mandatory, but he will not be able to solve both of them; </li><li> if he leaves at time $$$s=5$$$, then he can get $$$2$$$ points by solving all problems. </li></ul><p>Thus, the answer to this test is $$$2$$$.</p><p>Help Petya to determine the maximal number of points that he can receive, before leaving the exam.</p>",
