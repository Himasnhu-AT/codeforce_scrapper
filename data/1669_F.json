The answer is $$$2$$$ because they eat two candies in total.</p><p>For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $$$7$$$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $$$7$$$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $$$6$$$ (because they eat six candies in total).</p><p>For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $$$0$$$.</p><p>For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $$$[7, 3, 20]$$$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $$$[10, 8, 11, 1]$$$, they each eat $$$30$$$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $$$7$$$.</p>",
