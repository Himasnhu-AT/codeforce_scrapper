If Bob had such a stick, he sold it and got <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>x</i></sup></span> berllars. </li><li> Bob won some programming competition and got a <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>x</i></sup></span> MB memory stick as a prize. Bob could choose whether to present this memory stick to one of his friends, or keep it. </li></ul><p>Bob never kept more than one memory stick, as he feared to mix up their capacities, and deceive a customer unintentionally. It is also known that for each memory stick capacity there was at most one customer, who wanted to buy that memory stick.
