    "statement": "<p>You are given a binary matrix $$$a$$$ of size $$$n \\times m$$$. A binary matrix is a matrix where each element is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.</p><p>You may perform some (possibly zero) operations with this matrix. During each operation you can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix. Formally, inverting a row is changing all values in this row to the opposite ($$$0$$$ to $$$1$$$, $$$1$$$ to $$$0$$$). Inverting a column is changing all values in this column to the opposite.</p><p>Your task is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is considered <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sorted</span> if the array $$$[a_{1, 1}, a_{1, 2}, \\dots, a_{1, m}, a_{2, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \\dots, a_{2, m}, \\dots, a_{n, m - 1}, a_{n, m}]$$$ is sorted <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">in non-descending order</span>.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 200$$$) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.</p><p>The next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each. The $$$j$$$-th element in the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$a_{i, j}$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 1$$$) \u2014 the element of $$$a$$$ at position $$$(i, j)$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>If it is impossible to obtain a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">sorted</span> matrix, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" in the first line.</p><p>Otherwise print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" in the first line. In the second line print a string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character $$$r_i$$$ of this string should be '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>' if the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix is inverted and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>' otherwise. In the third line print a string $$$c$$$ of length $$$m$$$. The $$$j$$$-th character $$$c_j$$$ of this string should be '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>' if the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix is inverted and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.</p>",
