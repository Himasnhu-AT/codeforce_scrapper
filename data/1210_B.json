    "statement": "<p>Marcin is a coach in his university. There are $$$n$$$ students who want to attend a training camp. Marcin is a smart coach, so he wants to send only the students that can work calmly with each other.</p><p>Let's focus on the students. They are indexed with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each of them can be described with two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$; $$$b_i$$$ is equal to the skill level of the $$$i$$$-th student (the higher, the better). Also, there are $$$60$$$ known algorithms, which are numbered with integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$59$$$. If the $$$i$$$-th student knows the $$$j$$$-th algorithm, then the $$$j$$$-th bit ($$$2^j$$$) is set in the binary representation of $$$a_i$$$. Otherwise, this bit is not set.</p><p>Student $$$x$$$ thinks that he is better than student $$$y$$$ if and only if $$$x$$$ knows some algorithm which $$$y$$$ doesn't know. Note that two students can think that they are better than each other. A group of students can work together calmly if no student in this group thinks that he is better than everyone else in this group.</p><p>Marcin wants to send a group of at least two students which will work together calmly and will have the maximum possible sum of the skill levels. What is this sum?</p>",

The $$$i$$$-th of them is $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \\leq a_i &lt; 2^{60}$$$).</p><p>The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them is $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$).</p>",
