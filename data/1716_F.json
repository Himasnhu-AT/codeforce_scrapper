For every $$$i \\in [1, m]$$$, there is exactly one ball with number $$$i$$$ in each bag.</p><p>You have to take exactly one ball from each bag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball $$$1$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$2$$$ from the second bag is not the same as taking the ball $$$2$$$ from the first bag and the ball $$$1$$$ from the second bag). After that, you calculate the number of balls with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> numbers among the ones you have taken. Let the number of these balls be $$$F$$$.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the sum of $$$F^k$$$ over all possible ways to take $$$n$$$ balls, one from each bag.</p>",
