So, someone has to protect them, right?</span></p><p>You find yourself playing with Teucer again in the city of Liyue. As you take the eccentric little kid around, you notice something interesting about the structure of the city.</p><p>Liyue can be represented as a directed graph containing $$$n$$$ nodes. Nodes are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. There is a directed edge from node $$$a$$$ to node $$$b$$$ if and only if $$$a &lt; b$$$.</p><p>A path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at $$$a$$$, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at $$$b$$$. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length $$$x$$$ is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of $$$x$$$ edges.</p><p>Teucer's favorite number is $$$k$$$. You are curious about the following scenario: If you were to label each edge with a color, what is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length $$$k$$$ or longer are rainbow paths?</p><p>Teucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task!</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>On the first line, output $$$c$$$, the minimum colors you need to satisfy the above requirements.</p><p>On the second line, print a valid edge coloring as an array of $$$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$ integers ranging from $$$1$$$ to $$$c$$$. Exactly $$$c$$$ distinct colors should exist in the construction. Print the edges in increasing order by the start node first, then by the second node.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=4$$$, the edge colors will correspond to this order of edges: ($$$1$$$, $$$2$$$), ($$$1$$$, $$$3$$$), ($$$1$$$, $$$4$$$), ($$$2$$$, $$$3$$$), ($$$2$$$, $$$4$$$), ($$$3$$$, $$$4$$$)</p>",
