    "statement": "<p>Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. </p><p>Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.</p><p>Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>, such that the number of parts of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> in the first way differ from the number of parts of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> in the second way.</p>",
