    "statement": "<p>While looking at the kitchen fridge, the little boy Tyler noticed magnets with symbols, that can be aligned into a string $$$s$$$.</p><p>Tyler likes strings, and especially those that are lexicographically smaller than another string, $$$t$$$. After playing with magnets on the fridge, he is wondering, how many distinct strings can be composed out of letters of string $$$s$$$ by rearranging them, so that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the string $$$t$$$? Tyler is too young, so he can't answer this question. The alphabet Tyler uses is very large, so for your convenience he has already replaced the same letters in $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ to the same integers, keeping that different letters have been replaced to different integers.</p><p>We call a string $$$x$$$ lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ if one of the followings conditions is fulfilled: </p><ul> <li> There exists such position of symbol $$$m$$$ that is presented in both strings, so that before $$$m$$$-th symbol the strings are equal, and the $$$m$$$-th symbol of string $$$x$$$ is smaller than $$$m$$$-th symbol of string $$$y$$$. </li><li> String $$$x$$$ is the prefix of string $$$y$$$ and $$$x \\neq y$$$. </li></ul><p>Because the answer can be too large, print it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",

The string $$$[2\\, 2\\, 1]$$$ is lexicographically larger than the string $$$[2\\, 1\\, 2\\, 1]$$$, so we don't count it.</p><p>In the second example, all strings count except $$$[4\\, 3\\, 2\\, 1]$$$, so the answer is $$$4! - 1 = 23$$$.</p><p>In the third example, only the string $$$[1\\, 1\\, 1\\, 2]$$$ counts.</p>",
