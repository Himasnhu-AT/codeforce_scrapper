    "statement": "<p>Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day. </p><p>Boboniu designs a map for his $$$n$$$ mountains. He uses $$$n-1$$$ roads to connect all $$$n$$$ mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.</p><p>For the $$$i$$$-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as $$$t_i$$$. He also estimated the height of each mountain as $$$h_i$$$.</p><p>A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">path</span> is a sequence of mountains $$$M$$$ such that for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i &lt; |M|$$$), there exists a road between $$$M_i$$$ and $$$M_{i+1}$$$. Boboniu would regard the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">path</span> as a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">challenge</span> if for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1\\le i&lt;|M|$$$), $$$h_{M_i}\\le h_{M_{i+1}}$$$.</p><p>Boboniu wants to divide <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> $$$n-1$$$ roads into several <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">challenges</span>. Note that each road must appear in <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges. </p><p>Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">challenges</span>. The tiredness of a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">challenge</span> $$$M$$$ is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{|M|}t_{M_i}$$$. </p><p>He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.</p>",
