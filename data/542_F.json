    "statement": "<p>Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>, and the time <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> in minutes needed to complete the task. </p><p>An interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. </p><p>We know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).</p><p>Polycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>T</i></span> minutes at any variant of answering questions.</p>",
