In order to entertain themselves, DLS took a sheet of paper and drew $$$n$$$ distinct lines, given by equations $$$y = x + p_i$$$ for some distinct $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$.</p><p>Then JLS drew on the same paper sheet $$$m$$$ distinct lines given by equations $$$y = -x + q_i$$$ for some distinct $$$q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_m$$$.</p><p>DLS and JLS are interested in counting how many line pairs have <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">integer</span> intersection points, i.e. points with both coordinates that are integers. Unfortunately, the lesson will end up soon, so DLS and JLS are asking for your help.</p>",
