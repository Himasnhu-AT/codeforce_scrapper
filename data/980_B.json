The second village is located at $$$(4, 1)$$$ and its people love the Salmon pond at $$$(1, n)$$$.</p><p>The mayor of Fishtopia wants to place $$$k$$$ hotels in the city, each one occupying one cell. To allow people to enter the city from anywhere, hotels should not be placed on the border cells.</p><p>A person can move from one cell to another if those cells are not occupied by hotels and share a side.</p><p>Can you help the mayor place the hotels in a way such that there are equal number of shortest paths from each village to its preferred pond?</p>",
