    "statement": "<p>Two players are playing a game. They have a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once). The permutation is not sorted in either ascending or descending order (i.\u2009e. the permutation does not have the form $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$ or $$$[n, n-1, \\dots, 1]$$$).</p><p>Initially, all elements of the permutation are colored red. The players take turns. On their turn, the player can do one of three actions:</p><ul> <li> rearrange the elements of the permutation in such a way that all <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">red</span> elements keep their positions (note that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">blue</span> elements can be swapped with each other, but it's not obligatory); </li><li> change the color of one red element to blue; </li><li> skip the turn. </li></ul><p>The first player wins if the permutation is sorted in ascending order (i.\u2009e. it becomes $$$[1, 2, \\dots, n]$$$). The second player wins if the permutation is sorted in descending order (i.\u2009e. it becomes $$$[n, n-1, \\dots, 1]$$$). If the game lasts for $$$100^{500}$$$ turns and nobody wins, it ends in a draw.</p><p>Your task is to determine the result of the game if both players play optimally.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$\u00a0\u2014 the permutation itself. The permutation $$$p$$$ is not sorted in either ascending or descending order.</p><p>The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
