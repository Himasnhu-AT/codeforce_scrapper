You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>You are given an array $$$[a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n]$$$ consisting of integers $$$-1$$$, $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$. You have to build a partition of this array into the set of segments $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_k, r_k]$$$ with the following property:</p><ul> <li> Denote the alternating sum of all elements of the $$$i$$$-th segment as $$$s_i$$$: $$$s_i$$$ = $$$a_{l_i} - a_{l_i+1} + a_{l_i+2} - a_{l_i+3} + \\ldots \\pm a_{r_i}$$$. For example, the alternating sum of elements of segment $$$[2, 4]$$$ in array $$$[1, 0, -1, 1, 1]$$$ equals to $$$0 - (-1) + 1 = 2$$$. </li><li> The sum of $$$s_i$$$ over all segments of partition should be equal to zero. </li></ul><p>Note that each $$$s_i$$$ does <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> have to be equal to zero, this property is about sum of $$$s_i$$$ over all segments of partition.</p><p>The set of segments $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_k, r_k]$$$ is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">partition</span> of the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ if $$$1 = l_1 \\le r_1, l_2 \\le r_2, \\ldots, l_k \\le r_k = n$$$ and $$$r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots k-1$$$. In other words, each element of the array must belong to exactly one segment.</p><p>You have to build a partition of the given array with properties described above or determine that such partition does not exist.</p><p>Note that it is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> required to minimize the number of segments in the partition.</p>",

The following conditions should be satisfied:</p><ul> <li> $$$l_i \\le r_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. </li><li> $$$l_{i + 1} = r_i + 1$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$(k - 1)$$$. </li><li> $$$l_1 = 1, r_k = n$$$. </li></ul><p>If there are multiple correct partitions of the array, print any of them.</p>",
