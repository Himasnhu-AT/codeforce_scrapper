There are also zero or more digits marked by the character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">X</span>, meaning they're the same digit.</p><p>Mr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is divisible by $$$25$$$. Of course, $$$s$$$ must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">_</span> with any digit. He can also replace the character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">X</span> with any digit, but it must be the same for every character <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">X</span>.</p><p>As a note, a leading zero is any <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0025</span> has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> has no leading zero, but <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0000</span> has three leading zeroes).</p>",
