There are $$$m$$$ cats; the cat $$$i$$$ is present in steps from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$, inclusive. In each step, you can feed all the cats that are currently present or do nothing. </p><p>If you feed the same cat more than once, it will overeat, and you will immediately lose the game. Your goal is to feed as many cats as possible without causing any cat to overeat. </p><p>Find the maximum number of cats you can feed.</p><p>Formally, you need to select several integer points from the segment from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that among given segments, none covers two or more of the selected points, and as many segments as possible cover one of the selected points.</p>",
