When NIT snaps his fingers, he does the following operation on the array:</p><ul> <li> He selects positive integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$. Let $$$w=\\operatorname{mex}(\\{a_l,a_{l+1},\\dots,a_r\\})$$$. Then, for all $$$l\\le i\\le r$$$, set $$$a_i$$$ to $$$w$$$. </li></ul><p>We say the universe is destroyed if and only if for all $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, $$$a_i=0$$$ holds.</p><p>Find the minimum number of times NIT needs to snap his fingers to destroy the universe. That is, find the minimum number of operations NIT needs to perform to make all elements in the array equal to $$$0$$$.</p>",
