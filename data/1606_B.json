Initially it is installed only on the $$$1$$$-st computer.</p><p>Update files should be copied to all $$$n$$$ computers. The computers are not connected to the internet, so the only way to transfer update files from one computer to another is to copy them using a patch cable (a cable connecting two computers directly). Only one patch cable can be connected to a computer at a time. Thus, from any computer where the update files are installed, they can be copied to some other computer in exactly one hour.</p><p>Your task is to find the minimum number of hours required to copy the update files to all $$$n$$$ computers if there are only $$$k$$$ patch cables in Berland State University.</p>",
