Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ (including $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$) such that each number contains <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most</span> $$$k$$$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $$$998244353$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$k = 1$$$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $$$l = 10, r = 50$$$ the answer is $$$11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$$$.</p>",
