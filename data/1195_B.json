    "statement": "<p>Each evening after the dinner the SIS's students gather together to play the game of Sport Mafia. </p><p>For the tournament, Alya puts candies into the box, which will serve as a prize for a winner. To do that, she performs $$$n$$$ actions. The first action performed is to put a single candy into the box. For each of the remaining moves she can choose from two options:</p><ul> <li> the first option, in case the box contains at least one candy, is to take <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one candy out and eat it</span>. This way the number of candies in the box decreased by $$$1$$$; </li><li> the second option is to put candies in the box. In this case, Alya will put $$$1$$$ more candy, than she put in the previous time. </li></ul><p>Thus, if the box is empty, then it can only use the second option.</p><p>For example, one possible sequence of Alya's actions look as follows:</p><ul> <li> put one candy into the box; </li><li> put two candies into the box; </li><li> eat one candy from the box; </li><li> eat one candy from the box; </li><li> put three candies into the box; </li><li> eat one candy from the box; </li><li> put four candies into the box; </li><li> eat one candy from the box; </li><li> put five candies into the box; </li></ul><p>This way she will perform $$$9$$$ actions, the number of candies at the end will be $$$11$$$, while Alya will eat $$$4$$$ candies in total.</p><p>You know the total number of actions $$$n$$$ and the number of candies at the end $$$k$$$. You need to find the total number of sweets Alya ate. That is the number of moves of the first option. It's guaranteed, that for the given $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ the answer always exists.</p><p>Please note, that during an action of the first option, Alya takes out and eats exactly one candy.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$; $$$0 \\le k \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the total number of moves and the number of candies in the box at the end. </p><p>It's guaranteed, that for the given $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ the answer exists.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of candies, which Alya ate. Please note, that in this problem there aren't multiple possible answers\u00a0\u2014 the answer is unique for any input data. </p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example, Alya has made one move only. According to the statement, the first move is always putting one candy in the box. Hence Alya ate $$$0$$$ candies.</p><p>In the second example the possible sequence of Alya's actions looks as follows: </p><ul> <li> put $$$1$$$ candy, </li><li> put $$$2$$$ candies, </li><li> eat a candy, </li><li> eat a candy, </li><li> put $$$3$$$ candies, </li><li> eat a candy, </li><li> put $$$4$$$ candies, </li><li> eat a candy, </li><li> put $$$5$$$ candies. </li></ul> <p>This way, she will make exactly $$$n=9$$$ actions and in the end the box will contain $$$1+2-1-1+3-1+4-1+5=11$$$ candies. The answer is $$$4$$$, since she ate $$$4$$$ candies in total.</p>",
