He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.</p><p>He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules: </p><ul> <li> Initially, the graph has only one vertex. </li><li> Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k &gt; 1$$$). </li><li> Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least once</span>. </li></ul><p>The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/fe824c2b4d492a130f08a011d1b7f63735543344.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"360px\"/> </center><p>After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check if a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.</p>",
