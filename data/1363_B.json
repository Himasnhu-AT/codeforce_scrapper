A binary string is a string containing only characters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\".</p><p>He can perform the following operation on the string any amount of times: </p><ul> <li> Select an index of the string, and flip the character at that index. This means, if the character was \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>\", it becomes \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>\", and vice versa. </li></ul><p>A string is called good if it does not contain \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">010</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">101</span>\" as a subsequence \u00a0\u2014 for instance, \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1001</span>\" contains \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">101</span>\" as a subsequence, hence it is not a good string, while \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1000</span>\" doesn't contain neither \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">010</span>\" nor \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">101</span>\" as subsequences, so it is a good string.</p><p>What is the minimum number of operations he will have to perform, so that the string becomes good? It can be shown that with these operations we can make any string good.</p><p>A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.</p>",
