    "statement": "<p>Recently, Masha was presented with a chessboard with a height of $$$n$$$ and a width of $$$m$$$.</p><p>The rows on the chessboard are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top. The columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. Therefore, each cell can be specified with the coordinates $$$(x,y)$$$, where $$$x$$$ is the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">column</span> number, and $$$y$$$ is the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">row</span> number <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">(do not mix up)</span>.</p><p>Let us call a rectangle with coordinates $$$(a,b,c,d)$$$ a rectangle lower left point of which has coordinates $$$(a,b)$$$, and the upper right one\u00a0\u2014 $$$(c,d)$$$.</p><p>The chessboard is painted black and white as follows:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"302px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/79cc316122f3150d22e18e287a4d589d8c3dcd27.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"302px\"/> </center><center> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">An example of a chessboard.</span> </center><p>Masha was very happy with the gift and, therefore, invited her friends Maxim and Denis to show off. The guys decided to make her a treat\u00a0\u2014 they bought her a can of white and a can of black paint, so that if the old board deteriorates, it can be repainted. When they came to Masha, something unpleasant happened: first, Maxim went over the threshold and spilled <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">white</span> paint on the rectangle $$$(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)$$$. Then after him Denis spilled <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">black</span> paint on the rectangle $$$(x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4)$$$.</p><p>To spill paint of color $$$color$$$ onto a certain rectangle means that all the cells that belong to the given rectangle become $$$color$$$. The cell dyeing is superimposed on each other (if at first some cell is spilled with white paint and then with black one, then its color will be black).</p><p>Masha was shocked! She drove away from the guests and decided to find out how spoiled the gift was. For this, she needs to know the number of cells of white and black color. Help her find these numbers!</p>",
