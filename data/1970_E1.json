Cabin $$$i$$$ is connected with $$$s_i$$$ short trails and $$$l_i$$$ long trails to the lake.</p><p>Each day, Harry walks a trail from the cabin where he currently is to Lake Geneva, and then from there he walks a trail to any of the $$$m$$$ cabins (including the one he started in). However, as he has to finish the hike in a day, at least one of the two trails has to be short.</p><p>How many possible combinations of trails can Harry take if he starts in cabin 1 and walks for $$$n$$$ days?</p><p>Give the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.</p>",
