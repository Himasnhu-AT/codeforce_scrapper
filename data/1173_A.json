Note that each of the $$$x+y+z$$$ people would vote exactly one time.</p><p>There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be \"+\"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be \"-\"; otherwise the result will be \"0\".</p><p>Because of the $$$z$$$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $$$z$$$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.</p><p>Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.</p>",
