First player's box contains exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span> balls and second player's box contains exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub></span> balls. In one move first player can take from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span> balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub></span> balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. The one who can't make a move loses. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.</p>",
