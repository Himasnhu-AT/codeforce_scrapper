It can swap villains of any two holes, i.e. swap any two characters in the string; he can do this operation any number of times.</p><p>Now Iron Man asks Jarvis $$$q$$$ questions. In each question, he gives Jarvis two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Jarvis has to tell Iron Man the number of distinct colony arrangements he can create from the original one using his powers such that all villains having the same type as those originally living in $$$x$$$-th hole or $$$y$$$-th hole live in the same half and the Iron Man can destroy that colony arrangement.</p><p>Two colony arrangements are considered to be different if there exists a hole such that different types of villains are present in that hole in the arrangements.</p>",
