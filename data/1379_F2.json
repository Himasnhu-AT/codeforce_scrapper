The field is a chessboard $$$2n \\times 2m$$$: it has $$$2n$$$ rows, $$$2m$$$ columns, and the cell in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ is colored white if $$$i+j$$$ is even, and is colored black otherwise.</p><p>The game proceeds as follows: Ildar marks some of the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">white</span> cells of the chessboard as <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">unavailable</span>, and asks Ivan to place $$$n \\times m$$$ kings on the remaining <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">white</span> cells in such way, so that there are no kings attacking each other. A king can attack another king if they are located in the adjacent cells, sharing an edge or a corner.</p><p>Ildar would like to explore different combinations of cells. Initially all cells are marked as available, and then he has $$$q$$$ queries. In each query he either marks a cell as unavailable, or marks the previously unavailable cell as available. After each query he would like to know whether it is possible to place the kings on the available cells in a desired way. Please help him!</p>",
