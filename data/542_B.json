The hunter doesn't reload the gun immediately \u2014 <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> or more seconds must pass between the shots. When the hunter shoots up, the bullet immediately hits all the ducks who are directly above the hunter.</p><p>In a two dimensional world each duck is a horizontal segment that moves horizontally in the negative direction of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>Ox</i></span> axis at the speed <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> length unit per second.
