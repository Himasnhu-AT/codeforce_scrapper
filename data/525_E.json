She also has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> stickers with exclamation marks. We know that the number of stickers does not exceed the number of cubes.</p><p>Anya can stick an exclamation mark on the cube and get the factorial of the number written on the cube. For example, if a cube reads <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span>, then after the sticking it reads <span class=\"tex-span\">5!</span>, which equals <span class=\"tex-span\">120</span>.</p><p>You need to help Anya count how many ways there are to choose some of the cubes and stick on some of the chosen cubes at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> exclamation marks so that the sum of the numbers written on the chosen cubes after the sticking becomes equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>S</i></span>. Anya can stick at most one exclamation mark on each cube. Can you do it?</p><p>Two ways are considered the same if they have the same set of chosen cubes and the same set of cubes with exclamation marks.</p>",
