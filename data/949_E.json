    "statement": "<p>It is never too late to play the fancy \"Binary Cards\" game!</p><p>There is an infinite amount of cards of positive and negative ranks that are used in the game. The absolute value of any card rank is a power of two, i.e. each card has a rank of either <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>k</i></sup></span> or <span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009-\u20092<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>k</i></sup></span> for some integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009\u2265\u20090</span>. There is an infinite amount of cards of any valid rank.</p><p>At the beginning of the game player forms his deck that is some multiset (possibly empty) of cards. It is allowed to pick any number of cards of any rank but the small deck is considered to be a skill indicator. Game consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> rounds. In the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th round jury tells the player an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. After that the player is obligated to draw such a subset of his deck that the sum of ranks of the chosen cards is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (it is allowed to not draw any cards, in which case the sum is considered to be equal to zero). If player fails to do so, he loses and the game is over. Otherwise, player takes back all of his cards into his deck and the game proceeds to the next round. Player is considered a winner if he is able to draw the suitable set of cards in each of the rounds.</p><p>Somebody told you which numbers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> the jury is going to tell you in each round.
