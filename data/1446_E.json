The process of recovery begins. Each second, for <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> cell (even though there might be multiple cells that could change its state) one of the following happens:</p><ul> <li> A healthy cell with at least $$$2$$$ infected neighbors also becomes infected. </li><li> An infected cell with at least $$$2$$$ healthy neighbors also becomes healthy. </li></ul><p>If no such cell exists, the process of recovery stops. Patient is considered recovered if the process of recovery has stopped and all the cells are healthy.</p><p>We're interested in a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">worst-case</span> scenario: is it possible that the patient never recovers, or if it's not possible, what is the maximum possible duration of the recovery process?</p>",
