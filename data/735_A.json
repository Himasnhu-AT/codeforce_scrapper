    "statement": "<p>On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.</p><p>Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009=\u20091</span> the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009=\u20092</span> the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.</p><p>Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.</p>",

Character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span>' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">#</span>' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">G</span>' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">T</span>' means that the target insect is located at this cell.
