    "statement": "<p>You are given $$$n$$$ words, each of which consists of lowercase alphabet letters. Each word <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">contains at least</span> one vowel. You are going to choose some of the given words and make as many beautiful lyrics as possible.</p><p>Each <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">lyric</span> consists of two lines. Each <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">line</span> consists of two words separated by whitespace. </p><p>A lyric is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> if and only if it satisfies all conditions below. </p><ul> <li> The number of vowels in the first word of the first line is the same as the number of vowels in the first word of the second line. </li><li> The number of vowels in the second word of the first line is the same as the number of vowels in the second word of the second line. </li><li> The last vowel of the first line is the same as the last vowel of the second line. Note that there may be consonants after the vowel. </li></ul><p>Also, letters \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">e</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">i</span>\", and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">u</span>\" are vowels. Note that \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">y</span>\" is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">never</span> vowel.</p><p>For example of a beautiful lyric, </p><center> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hello hellooowww</span>\" <p>\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">whatsup yowowowow</span>\" </p></center> is a beautiful lyric because there are two vowels each in \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hello</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">whatsup</span>\", four vowels each in \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hellooowww</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yowowowow</span>\" (keep in mind that \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">y</span>\" is not a vowel), and the last vowel of each line is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>\".<p>For example of a not beautiful lyric, </p><center> \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hey man</span>\"<p>\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">iam mcdic</span>\" </p></center> is not a beautiful lyric because \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hey</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">iam</span>\" don't have same number of vowels and the last vowels of two lines are different (\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>\" in the first and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">i</span>\" in the second).<p>How many beautiful lyrics can you write from given words? Note that you cannot use a word more times than it is given to you. For example, if a word is given three times, you can use it at most three times.</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example, those beautiful lyrics are one of the possible answers. Let's look at the first lyric on the sample output of the first example. \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">about proud hooray round</span>\" forms a beautiful lyric because \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">about</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hooray</span>\" have same number of vowels, \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">proud</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">round</span>\" have same number of vowels, and both lines have same last vowel. On the other hand, you cannot form any beautiful lyric with the word \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">codeforces</span>\".</p><p>In the second example, you cannot form any beautiful lyric from given words.</p><p>In the third example, you can use the word \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">same</span>\" up to three times.</p>",
