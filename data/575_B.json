    "statement": "<p>Ruritania is a country with a very badly maintained road network, which is not exactly good news for lorry drivers that constantly have to do deliveries. In fact, when roads are maintained, they become <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one-way</span>. It turns out that it is sometimes impossible to get from one town to another in a legal way \u2013 however, we know that all towns are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">reachable</span>, though <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">illegally</span>!</p><p>Fortunately for us, the police tend to be very corrupt and they will allow a lorry driver to break the rules and drive in the wrong direction provided they receive \u2018a small gift\u2019. There is one patrol car for every road and they will request 1000 Ruritanian dinars when a driver drives in the wrong direction. However, being greedy, every time a patrol car notices the same driver breaking the rule, they will charge <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">double</span> the amount of money they requested the previous time on that particular road.</p><p>Borna is a lorry driver that managed to figure out this bribing pattern. As part of his job, he has to make <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>K</i></span> stops in some towns all over Ruritania and he has to make these stops in a certain order. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span> towns (enumerated from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i></span>) in Ruritania and Borna\u2019s initial location is the capital city i.e. town 1. He happens to know which ones out of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>N</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> roads in Ruritania are currently unidirectional, but he is unable to compute the least amount of money he needs to prepare for bribing the police. Help Borna by providing him with an answer and you will be richly rewarded.</p>",
