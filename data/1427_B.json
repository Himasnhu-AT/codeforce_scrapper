When you lose a game you get $$$0$$$ points. When you win you get $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$ points: if you have won also the previous game you get $$$2$$$ points, otherwise you get $$$1$$$ point. If you win the very first game of the tournament you get $$$1$$$ point (since there is not a \"previous game\").</p><p>The outcomes of the $$$n$$$ games are represented by a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$: the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span> if you have won the $$$i$$$-th game, while it is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span> if you have lost the $$$i$$$-th game.</p><p>After the tournament, you notice a bug on the website that allows you to change the outcome of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most</span> $$$k$$$ of your games (meaning that at most $$$k$$$ times you can change some symbol <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span> to <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span>, or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">W</span> to <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>).
