On day $$$i$$$ Doremy will choose whether to test contest $$$i$$$ or not. She can only test a contest if her current IQ is strictly greater than $$$0$$$.</p><p>If Doremy chooses to test contest $$$i$$$ on day $$$i$$$, the following happens: </p><ul> <li> if $$$a_i&gt;q$$$, Doremy will feel she is not wise enough, so $$$q$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$; </li><li> otherwise, nothing changes. </li></ul> If she chooses not to test a contest, nothing changes.<p>Doremy wants to test as many contests as possible.
