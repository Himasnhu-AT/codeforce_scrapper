You can increase length of some of them by some positive integer number of centimeters (different sticks can be increased by a different length), but in total by at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> centimeters. In particular, it is allowed not to increase the length of any stick.</p><p>Determine the number of ways to increase the lengths of some sticks so that you can form from them a non-degenerate (that is, having a positive area) triangle. Two ways are considered different, if the length of some stick is increased by different number of centimeters in them.</p>",
