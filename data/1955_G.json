    "statement": "<p>Not long ago, Egor learned about the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The greatest common divisor of two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is the largest number that divides both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ without leaving a remainder. With this knowledge, Egor can solve a problem that he once couldn't.</p><p>Vasily has a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, and the integer $$${a_i}_j$$$ is located at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column. Egor wants to go from the top left corner (at the intersection of the first row and the first column) to the bottom right corner (at the intersection of the last row and the last column) and find the greatest common divisor of all the numbers along the path. He is only allowed to move down and to the right. Egor has written down several paths and obtained different GCD values. He became interested in finding the maximum possible GCD.</p><p>Unfortunately, Egor is tired of calculating GCDs, so he asks for your help in finding the maximum GCD of the integers along the path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid.</p>",
