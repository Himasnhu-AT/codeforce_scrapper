There are heaters in some positions of the array. The $$$i$$$-th element of the array is $$$1$$$ if there is a heater in the position $$$i$$$, otherwise the $$$i$$$-th element of the array is $$$0$$$.</p><p>Each heater has a value $$$r$$$ ($$$r$$$ is the same for all heaters). This value means that the heater at the position $$$pos$$$ can warm up all the elements in range $$$[pos - r + 1; pos + r - 1]$$$.</p><p>Vova likes to walk through his house while he thinks, and he hates cold positions of his house. Vova wants to switch some of his heaters on in such a way that each element of his house will be warmed up by at least one heater. </p><p>Vova's target is to warm up the whole house (all the elements of the array), i.e. if $$$n = 6$$$, $$$r = 2$$$ and heaters are at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, then Vova can warm up the whole house if he switches all the heaters in the house on (then the first $$$3$$$ elements will be warmed up by the first heater and the last $$$3$$$ elements will be warmed up by the second heater).</p><p>Initially, all the heaters are off.</p><p>But from the other hand, Vova didn't like to pay much for the electricity. So he wants to switch the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of heaters on in such a way that each element of his house is warmed up by at least one heater.</p><p>Your task is to find this number of heaters or say that it is impossible to warm up the whole house.</p>",
