    "statement": "<p>Indiana Jones found ancient Aztec catacombs containing a golden idol. The catacombs consists of $$$n$$$ caves. Each pair of caves is connected with a two-way corridor that can be opened or closed. The entrance to the catacombs is in the cave $$$1$$$, the idol and the exit are in the cave $$$n$$$.</p><p>When Indiana goes from a cave $$$x$$$ to a cave $$$y$$$ using an open corridor, all corridors connected to the cave $$$x$$$ change their state: all open corridors become closed, all closed corridors become open. Indiana wants to go from cave $$$1$$$ to cave $$$n$$$ going through as small number of corridors as possible. Help him find the optimal path, or determine that it is impossible to get out of catacombs.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 3\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of caves and the number of open corridors at the initial moment.</p><p>The next $$$m$$$ lines describe the open corridors. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the caves connected by the $$$i$$$-th open corridor.

In the second line print $$$k+1$$$ integers $$$x_0, \\ldots, x_k$$$\u00a0\u2014 the number of caves in the order Indiana should visit them. The sequence $$$x_0, \\ldots, x_k$$$ should satisfy the following:</p><ul><li> $$$x_0 = 1$$$, $$$x_k = n$$$;</li><li> for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ the corridor from $$$x_{i - 1}$$$ to $$$x_i$$$ should be open at the moment Indiana walks along this corridor.</li></ul><p>If there is no path, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.</p><p>We can show that if there is a path, there is a path consisting of no more than $$$10^6$$$ corridors.</p>",
