More formally, let your answer be $$$ans$$$ and the number of divisors of $$$X$$$ be $$$d$$$, then your answer will be considered correct if <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least one</span> of the two following conditions is true:</p><ul><li> $$$| ans - d | \\le 7$$$;</li><li> $$$\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{ans}{d} \\le 2$$$.</li></ul><p>You can make at most $$$22$$$ queries.

    "note": "<p>Why the limitation for number of queries is 22 exactly? Maybe the problem author is a Taylor Swift fan.</p><p>Let's look at the example.</p><p>In the first game $$$X = 998\\,244\\,353$$$ is hidden. Would be hard to guess this, right? This number is prime, so the number of its divisors is 2. The solution has made several random queries, and all the responses turned out to be 1 (strange things, not even one of three random numbers is divisible by $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$). It's fare to assume that the hidden number doesn't have many divisors, so the solution has answered 5. Why not. This answer will be considered correct since $$$| 5 - 2 | = 3 \\le 7$$$.</p><p>In the second game $$$X = 4\\,194\\,304 = 2^{22}$$$ is hidden, it has 23 divisors. The solution has made queries $$$1024 = 2^{10}$$$, $$$1\\,048\\,576 =2^{20}$$$, $$$1\\,073\\,741\\,824 = 2^{30}$$$ and got responses $$$1024 = 2^{10}$$$, $$$1\\,048\\,576 =2^{20}$$$, $$$4\\,194\\,304 = 2^{22}$$$, respectively. Then the solution got completely confused and answered the answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. This answer will be considered correct since $$$\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{42}{23} \\le 2$$$.</p>",
