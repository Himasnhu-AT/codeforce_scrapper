    "statement": "<p>Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">returns the balls</span> to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.</p><p>Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> and Jerry must have drawn the <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> and Jerry's sum is <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span>, so Jerry never has a higher total.</p><p>In the second case, each game could've had three outcomes \u2014 <span class=\"tex-span\">10\u2009-\u20092</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">10\u2009-\u20091</span>, or <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009-\u20091</span>.
