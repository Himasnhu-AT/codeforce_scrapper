    "statement": "<p>For his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$$$ as a gift.</p><p>He is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$, he wants to maximize the value $$$$$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert,$$$$$$ where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$.</p><p>Help Kevin to do that.</p>",

Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\leq 1\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the set.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case print a single line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements. </p><p>Formally, you have to print a permutation $$$p$$$ which maximizes the value $$$\\min \\limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \\lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \\rvert$$$.</p><p>If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.</p>",

It's easy to prove that this answer is optimal.</p><p>In the second test case each permutation of numbers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ is an optimal answer. The minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements equals to $$$1$$$.</p>",
