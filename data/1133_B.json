Each gift will consist of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly two</span> boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $$$k$$$. In other words, two boxes $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\ne j$$$) can be combined as a gift if $$$d_i + d_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.</p><p>How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes \"partially\" or redistribute candies between them. </p>",
