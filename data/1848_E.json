    "statement": "<p>In Vika's hometown, Vladivostok, there is a beautiful sea.</p><p>Often you can see kids skimming stones. This is the process of throwing a stone into the sea at a small angle, causing it to fly far and bounce several times off the water surface.</p><p>Vika has skimmed stones many times and knows that if you throw a stone from the shore perpendicular to the coastline with a force of $$$f$$$, it will first touch the water at a distance of $$$f$$$ from the shore, then bounce off and touch the water again at a distance of $$$f - 1$$$ from the previous point of contact. The stone will continue to fly in a straight line, reducing the distances between the points where it touches the water, until it falls into the sea.</p><p>Formally, the points at which the stone touches the water surface will have the following coordinates: $$$f$$$, $$$f + (f - 1)$$$, $$$f + (f - 1) + (f - 2)$$$, ... , $$$f + (f - 1) + (f - 2) + \\ldots + 1$$$ (assuming that $$$0$$$ is the coordinate of the shoreline).</p><p>Once, while walking along the embankment of Vladivostok in the evening, Vika saw a group of guys skipping stones across the sea, launching them from the same point with different forces.</p><p>She became interested in what is the maximum number of guys who can launch a stone with their force $$$f_i$$$, so that all $$$f_i$$$ are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different positive integers</span>, and all $$$n$$$ stones touched the water at the point with the coordinate $$$x$$$ (assuming that $$$0$$$ is the coordinate of the shoreline).</p><p>After thinking a little, Vika answered her question. After that, she began to analyze how the answer to her question would change if she multiplied the coordinate $$$x$$$ by some positive integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ... , $$$x_q$$$, which she picked for analysis.</p><p>Vika finds it difficult to cope with such analysis on her own, so she turned to you for help.</p><p>Formally, Vika is interested in the answer to her question for the coordinates $$$X_1 = x \\cdot x_1$$$, $$$X_2 = X_1 \\cdot x_2$$$, ... , $$$X_q = X_{q-1} \\cdot x_q$$$. Since the answer for such coordinates can be quite large, find it modulo $$$M$$$. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">It is guaranteed that $$$M$$$ is prime.</span></p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains three integers $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le 10^9$$$), $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) and $$$M$$$ ($$$100 \\le M \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial coordinate for which Vika answered the question on her own, the number of integers $$$x_i$$$ by which Vika will multiply the initial coordinate and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">prime</span> module $$$M$$$.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_q$$$ ($$$1 \\le x_i \\le 10^6$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the integers described in the statement.</p>",
