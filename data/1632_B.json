    "statement": "<p>It has finally been decided to build a roof over the football field in School 179. Its construction will require placing $$$n$$$ consecutive vertical pillars. Furthermore, the headmaster wants the heights of all the pillars to form a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ is the height of the $$$i$$$-th pillar from the left $$$(1 \\le i \\le n)$$$.</p><p>As the chief, you know that the cost of construction of consecutive pillars is equal to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the maximum value of the bitwise XOR</span> of heights of all pairs of adjacent pillars. In other words, the cost of construction is equal to $$$\\max\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le n - 1}{p_i \\oplus p_{i + 1}}$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR operation</a>.</p><p>Find any sequence of pillar heights $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with the smallest construction cost.</p><p>In this problem, a permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,0,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,0,1]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$1$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,0,3]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but $$$3$$$ is in the array).</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The only line for each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of pillars for the construction of the roof.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$p_n$$$ \u2014 the sequence of pillar heights with the smallest construction cost.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p>",
