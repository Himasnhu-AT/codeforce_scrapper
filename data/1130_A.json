Note that those positive numbers do not need to be an integer (e.g., a $$$2.5$$$ counts as a positive number). If there are multiple values of $$$d$$$ that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them. In case that there is no such $$$d$$$, print a single integer $$$0$$$.</p><p>Recall that $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ represents the smallest integer that is not less than $$$x$$$ and that zero ($$$0$$$) is neither positive nor negative.</p>",
