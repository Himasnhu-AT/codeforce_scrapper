Because of shortage of time they want to check their program with some queries. So they hired Hormizd (one of the greatest programmers in world) to write a tester for GNU's new program. Because Hormizd has much more important things to do, he wants you to write a small part of tester and it is reversing the numbers. Help him before 1:59:26.</p><p>We can reverse numbers easily. For example by reversing <span class=\"tex-span\">1234</span> we get <span class=\"tex-span\">4321</span>.</p><p>Note, that if the integer is negative then its reverse would be also negative. For example reverse of <span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009-\u2009123</span> is <span class=\"tex-span\">\u2009-\u2009321</span>.</p><p>Also, you have to delete all the leading zeroes before and after the reverse.</p><p>Given an integer you have to help Hormizd reverse it.</p>",
