The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>.</p><p>Will the robot be able to build the fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>?</p>",
