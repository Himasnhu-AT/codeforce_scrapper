He wonders how many fibonacci-like sequences of length $$$k$$$ can be formed with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">$$$n$$$ as the $$$k$$$-th element</span> of the sequence. </p><p>A sequence of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-decreasing non-negative</span> integers is considered fibonacci-like if $$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$$$ for all $$$i &gt; 2$$$, where $$$f_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th element in the sequence. Note that $$$f_1$$$ and $$$f_2$$$ can be arbitrary.</p><p>For example, sequences such as $$$[4,5,9,14]$$$ and $$$[0,1,1]$$$ are considered fibonacci-like sequences, while $$$[0,0,0,1,1]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 1, 3]$$$, and $$$[-1,-1,-2]$$$ are not: the first two do not always satisfy $$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$$$, the latter does not satisfy that the elements are non-negative.</p><p>Impress Ntarsis by helping him with this task.</p>",
