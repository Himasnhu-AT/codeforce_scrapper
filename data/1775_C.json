Then he suggested his friend Petya find such a minimal $$$m$$$ ($$$m \\ge n$$$) that the equality on the board holds.</p><p>Unfortunately, Petya couldn't solve this problem in his head and decided to ask for computer help. He quickly wrote a program and found the answer.</p><p>Can you solve this difficult problem?</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/031794267bde972f35f17902ed959e8302b26c14.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center>",
