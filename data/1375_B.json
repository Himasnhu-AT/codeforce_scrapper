Note that if the number in the cell is $$$0$$$, there is no such restriction on neighboring cells.</p><p>You are allowed to take any number in the grid and increase it by $$$1$$$. You may apply this operation as many times as you want, to any numbers you want. Perform some operations (possibly zero) to make the grid good, or say that it is impossible.
