The score is initially $$$0$$$. The game consists of $$$n$$$ turns. Each turn, Alice picks a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">real</span> number from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$ (inclusive) which Bob either adds to or subtracts from the score of the game. But throughout the game, Bob has to choose to add at least $$$m$$$ out of the $$$n$$$ turns.</p><p>Bob gets to know which number Alice picked before deciding whether to add or subtract the number from the score, and Alice gets to know whether Bob added or subtracted the number for the previous turn before picking the number for the current turn (except on the first turn since there was no previous turn).</p><p>If Alice and Bob play optimally, what will the final score of the game be?</p>",
