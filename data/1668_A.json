The intersection of the $$$a$$$-th row and $$$b$$$-th column is denoted by $$$(a, b)$$$. </p><p>Initially, you are standing in the top left corner $$$(1, 1)$$$. Your goal is to reach the bottom right corner $$$(n, m)$$$.</p><p>You can move in four directions from $$$(a, b)$$$: up to $$$(a-1, b)$$$, down to $$$(a+1, b)$$$, left to $$$(a, b-1)$$$ or right to $$$(a, b+1)$$$.</p><p>You cannot move in the same direction in two consecutive moves, and you cannot leave the grid.
