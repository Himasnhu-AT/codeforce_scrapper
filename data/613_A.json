    "statement": "<p>Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path.</p><p>Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine.</p><p>Peter decided to tie his car to point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>P</i></span> and now he is wondering what is the area of \u200b\u200bthe region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.</p>",
