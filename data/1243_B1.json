He decided to get his strings in order first.</p><p>Ujan has two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only of lowercase English characters. He wants to make them equal. Since Ujan is lazy, he will perform the following operation exactly once: he takes two positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i,j \\le n$$$, the values $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ can be equal or different), and swaps the characters $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_j$$$.
