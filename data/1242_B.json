This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.</p><p>It is an undirected weighted graph on $$$n$$$ vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$; exactly $$$m$$$ edges have weight $$$1$$$, and all others have weight $$$0$$$.</p><p>Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?</p>",
