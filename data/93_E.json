    "statement": "<p>Igor K. very much likes a multiplayer role playing game WineAge II. Who knows, perhaps, that might be the reason for his poor performance at the university. As any person who plays the game, he is interested in equipping his hero with as good weapon and outfit as possible. </p><p>One day, as he was reading the game's forum yet again, he discovered a very interesting fact. As it turns out, each weapon in the game is characterised with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> different numbers: <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>k</i></sub></span>. They are called hit indicators and according to the game developers' plan they are pairwise coprime. </p><p>The damage that is inflicted during a hit depends not only on the weapon's characteristics, but also on the hero's strength parameter. Thus, if the hero's strength equals <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, than the inflicted damage will be calculated as the number of numbers on the segment <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/68f0ea4caea983197d3454dee41e9ad4ed403e49.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, that aren't divisible by any hit indicator <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>.</p><p>Recently, having fulfilled another quest, Igor K. found a new Lostborn sword. He wants to know how much damage he will inflict upon his enemies if he uses it.</p>",
