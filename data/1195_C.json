Students are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in each row in order from left to right.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/bf391a96cdb51467057f2a6fae4d88e745e0fc53.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Now Demid wants to choose a team to play basketball. He will choose players from left to right, and the index of each chosen player (excluding the first one <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">taken</span>) will be strictly greater than the index of the previously chosen player. To avoid giving preference to one of the rows, Demid chooses students in such a way that no consecutive chosen students belong to the same row. The first student can be chosen among all $$$2n$$$ students (there are no additional constraints), and a team can consist of any number of students. </p><p>Demid thinks, that in order to compose a perfect team, he should choose students in such a way, that the total height of all chosen students is maximum possible. Help Demid to find the maximum possible total height of players in a team he can choose.</p>",
