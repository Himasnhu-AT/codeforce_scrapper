Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as $$$path(v)$$$.

The question is next: what is the maximum value $$$y$$$ such that $$$y$$$ is contained in at least $$$k$$$ different lists $$$path(x)$$$?</p><p>Formally speaking, you need to find maximum $$$y$$$ such that $$$\\left| \\{ x ~|~ 1 \\le x \\le n, y \\in path(x) \\} \\right| \\ge k$$$.</p>",
