That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the $$$i$$$-th sign occurred in the year $$$x$$$, the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence of the $$$(i+1)$$$-th sign, starting from the year $$$x+1$$$.</p><p>In which year will the $$$n$$$-th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?</p>",
