    "statement": "<p>Fedya loves problems involving data structures. Especially ones about different queries on subsegments. Fedya had a nice array $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots a_n$$$ and a beautiful data structure. This data structure, given $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$, could find the greatest integer $$$d$$$, such that $$$d$$$ divides each of $$$a_l$$$, $$$a_{l+1}$$$, ..., $$$a_{r}$$$. </p><p>Fedya really likes this data structure, so he applied it to every non-empty contiguous subarray of array $$$a$$$, put all answers into the array and sorted it. He called this array $$$b$$$. It's easy to see that array $$$b$$$ contains $$$n(n+1)/2$$$ elements.</p><p>After that, Fedya implemented another cool data structure, that allowed him to find sum $$$b_l + b_{l+1} + \\ldots + b_r$$$ for given $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n(n+1)/2$$$. Surely, Fedya applied this data structure to every contiguous subarray of array $$$b$$$, called the result $$$c$$$ and sorted it. Help Fedya find the lower median of array $$$c$$$.</p><p>Recall that for a sorted array of length $$$k$$$ the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">lower median</span> is an element at position $$$\\lfloor \\frac{k + 1}{2} \\rfloor$$$, if elements of the array are enumerated starting from $$$1$$$. For example, the lower median of array $$$(1, 1, 2, 3, 6)$$$ is $$$2$$$, and the lower median of $$$(0, 17, 23, 96)$$$ is $$$17$$$.</p>",
