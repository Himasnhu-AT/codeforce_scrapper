    "statement": "<p>Polycarp has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.</p><p>He wants to play a game with this array. The game consists of several moves. On the first move he chooses any element and deletes it (after the first move the array contains $$$n-1$$$ elements). For each of the next moves he chooses any element with the only restriction: its parity should differ from the parity of the element deleted on the previous move. In other words, he alternates parities (even-odd-even-odd-... or odd-even-odd-even-...) of the removed elements. Polycarp stops if he can't make a move.</p><p>Formally: </p><ul> <li> If it is the first move, he chooses any element and deletes it; </li><li> If it is the second or any next move: <ul> <li> if the last deleted element was <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span>, Polycarp chooses any <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even</span> element and deletes it; </li><li> if the last deleted element was <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even</span>, Polycarp chooses any <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> element and deletes it. </li></ul> </li><li> If after some move Polycarp cannot make a move, the game ends. </li></ul><p>Polycarp's goal is to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimize</span> the sum of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-deleted</span> elements of the array after end of the game.
