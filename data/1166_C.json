    "statement": "<p>The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $$$|x|$$$ and $$$|y|$$$ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $$$|x - y|$$$ and $$$|x + y|$$$ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.</p><p>Here $$$|z|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$z$$$.</p><p>Now, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Now, he wants to know the number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">unordered</span> pairs formed by two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> elements from these $$$n$$$ integers such that the legend could be true if $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.</p>",

For the pair $$$\\{5, -3\\}$$$ the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval $$$[3, 5]$$$ and Vectorland consisting of the interval $$$[2, 8]$$$:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f7988e7601241c67710cb88d6141914b40505f8e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>As Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair $$$\\{2, -3\\}$$$, for a total of two pairs.</p><p>In the second sample, the only pair is $$$\\{3, 6\\}$$$, and the situation looks as follows:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/953449cc2ca4c7080df35397935226dd9842ff33.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share $$$3$$$ as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.</p>",
