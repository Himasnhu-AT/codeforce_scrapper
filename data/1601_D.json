As an alpinist climbs a mountain, they affect the path and thus may change mountain difficulty. Specifically, if an alpinist of neatness $$$a$$$ climbs a mountain of difficulty $$$p$$$ the difficulty of this mountain becomes $$$\\max(p, a)$$$. </p><p>Alpinists will climb the mountain one by one. And before the start, they wonder, what is the maximum number of alpinists who will be able to climb the mountain if they choose the right order. As you are the only person in the group who does programming, you are to answer the question.</p><p>Note that after the order is chosen, each alpinist who can climb the mountain, must climb the mountain at that time. </p>",
