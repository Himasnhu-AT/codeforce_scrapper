For example, if the cities are located in points $$$[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]$$$, then:</p><ul> <li> the closest city to the city $$$1$$$ is the city $$$2$$$; </li><li> the closest city to the city $$$2$$$ is the city $$$3$$$; </li><li> the closest city to the city $$$3$$$ is the city $$$4$$$; </li><li> the closest city to the city $$$4$$$ is the city $$$3$$$; </li><li> the closest city to the city $$$5$$$ is the city $$$4$$$. </li></ul><p>The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, since this would mean that the city $$$2$$$ has two closest cities ($$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$, both having distance $$$1$$$).</p><p>You can travel between cities.
