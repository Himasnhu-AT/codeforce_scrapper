In order to increase the traffic flow, mayor of the city has decided to make each street one way. This means in each horizontal street, the traffic moves only from west to east or only from east to west. Also, traffic moves only from north to south or only from south to north in each vertical street. It is possible to enter a horizontal street from a vertical street, or vice versa, at their intersection.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/8d9eab12ac55ed31138ea165068c27da020c7d16.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>The mayor has received some street direction patterns.
