Vertices are numbered <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> through <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>.</p><p>Limak is a little polar bear and Radewoosh is his evil enemy. Limak once had a tree but Radewoosh stolen it. Bear is very sad now because he doesn't remember much about the tree\u00a0\u2014 he can tell you only three values <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span>:</p><ul> <li> The tree had exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> vertices. </li><li> The tree had diameter <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span>. In other words, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> was the biggest distance between two vertices. </li><li> Limak also remembers that he once rooted the tree in vertex <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and after that its height was <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span>. In other words, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span> was the biggest distance between vertex <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and some other vertex. </li></ul><p>The distance between two vertices of the tree is the number of edges on the simple path between them.</p><p>Help Limak to restore his tree. Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions. Find any such tree and print its edges in any order.
