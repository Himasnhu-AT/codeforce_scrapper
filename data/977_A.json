    "statement": "<p>Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:</p><ul> <li> if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one; </li><li> if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit). </li></ul><p>You are given an integer number $$$n$$$. Tanya will subtract one from it $$$k$$$ times. Your task is to print the result after all $$$k$$$ subtractions.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.</p>",
