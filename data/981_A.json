For example, the strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">kek</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abacaba</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">r</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">papicipap</span>\" are palindromes, while the strings \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abb</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">iq</span>\" are not.</p><p>A substring $$$s[l \\ldots r]$$$ ($$$1\u2009\\leq\u2009l\u2009\\leq\u2009r\u2009\\leq\u2009|s|$$$) of a string $$$s\u2009=\u2009s_{1}s_{2} \\ldots s_{|s|}$$$ is the string $$$s_{l}s_{l\u2009+\u20091} \\ldots s_{r}$$$.</p><p>Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $$$s$$$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $$$s$$$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.</p><p>Some time ago Ann read the word $$$s$$$. What is the word she changed it into?</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>If there is such a substring in $$$s$$$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $$$0$$$.</p><p>Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.</p>",

    "note": "<p>\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">mew</span>\" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">mew</span>\" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $$$3$$$.</p><p>The string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">uffuw</span>\" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $$$5$$$) of the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">wuffuw</span>\", so the answer for the second example is $$$5$$$.</p><p>All substrings of the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">qqqqqqqq</span>\" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $$$0$$$.</p>",
