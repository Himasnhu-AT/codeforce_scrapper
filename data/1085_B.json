Today he wants to solve $$$(x~\\mathrm{div}~k) \\cdot (x \\bmod k) = n$$$, where $$$\\mathrm{div}$$$ and $$$\\mathrm{mod}$$$ stand for integer division and modulo operations (refer to the Notes below for exact definition). In this equation, $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ are positive integer parameters, and $$$x$$$ is a positive integer unknown. If there are several solutions, Vasya wants to find the smallest possible $$$x$$$. Can you help him?</p>",
