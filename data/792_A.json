But all buses and roads are very old, so the Minister of Transport decided to build a new bus route. The Minister doesn't want to spend large amounts of money \u2014 he wants to choose two cities in such a way that the distance between them is minimal possible. The distance between two cities is equal to the absolute value of the difference between their coordinates.</p><p>It is possible that there are multiple pairs of cities with minimal possible distance, so the Minister wants to know the quantity of such pairs. </p><p>Your task is to write a program that will calculate the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs which have this distance.</p>",
