Yet suddenly, the Doctor popped out of the TARDIS and told her that he had spied on the Daleks' preparations, and there is more of them than ever. Desperate times require desperate measures, so Heidi is going to risk meeting with the Daleks and she will consider placing a trap along <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">any</span> Corridor.</p><p>This means she needs your help again in calculating $$$E_{max}(c)$$$ \u2013 the largest $$$e \\le 10^9$$$ such that if we changed the energy requirement of $$$c$$$ to $$$e$$$, then the Daleks might use $$$c$$$ in their invasion \u2013 but this time for all Time Corridors.</p>",
