The $$$i$$$-th problem has beauty score equal to $$$b_i$$$ and difficulty equal to $$$d_i$$$. The beauty and the difficulty are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$. </p><p>If there are no problems with a certain difficulty (the possible difficulties are $$$1,2,\\dots,10$$$) then Gianni will ask for more problems to the judges.</p><p>Otherwise, for each difficulty between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$, he will put in the problem set one of the most beautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain exactly $$$10$$$ problems with distinct difficulties).
