    "statement": "<p>Once upon a time in the thicket of the mushroom forest lived mushroom gnomes. They were famous among their neighbors for their magic mushrooms. Their magic nature made it possible that between every two neighboring mushrooms every minute grew another mushroom with the weight equal to the sum of weights of two neighboring ones. </p><p>The mushroom gnomes loved it when everything was in order, that's why they always planted the mushrooms in one line in the order of their weights' increasing. Well... The gnomes planted the mushrooms and went to eat. After <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> minutes they returned and saw that new mushrooms had grown up, so that the increasing order had been violated. The gnomes replanted all the mushrooms in the correct order, that is, they sorted the mushrooms in the order of the weights' increasing. And went to eat again (those gnomes were quite big eaters). What total weights modulo <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> will the mushrooms have in another <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span> minutes?</p>",
