Each badge has a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">coolness factor</span>, which shows how much it's owner reached. Coolness factor can be increased by one for the cost of one coin. </p><p>For every pair of soldiers one of them should get a badge with strictly higher factor than the second one. Exact values of their factors aren't important, they just need to have distinct factors. </p><p>Colonel knows, which soldier is supposed to get which badge initially, but there is a problem. Some of badges may have the same factor of coolness. Help him and calculate how much money has to be paid for making all badges have different factors of coolness.</p>",
