    "statement": "<p>You are given a piece of paper in the shape of a simple polygon $$$S$$$. Your task is to turn it into a simple polygon $$$T$$$ that has the same area as $$$S$$$.</p><p>You can use two tools: scissors and tape. Scissors can be used to cut any polygon into smaller polygonal pieces. Tape can be used to combine smaller pieces into larger polygons. You can use each tool multiple times, in any order. </p><p>The polygons given in the input have integer coordinates, but you are allowed to produce shapes with <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">non-integer coordinates</span> in your output.</p><p>A formal definition of the task follows.</p><p>A <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">shape</span> $$$Q=(Q_0,\\dots,Q_{n-1})$$$ is a sequence of three or more points in the plane such that: </p><ul> <li> The closed polyline $$$Q_0Q_1Q_2\\dots Q_{n-1}Q_0$$$ never touches or intersects itself, and therefore it forms the boundary of a simple polygon. </li><li> The polyline goes around the boundary of the polygon in the counter-clockwise direction. </li></ul><p>The polygon whose boundary is the shape $$$Q$$$ will be denoted $$$P(Q)$$$.</p><p>Two shapes are called <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">equivalent</span> if one can be translated and/or rotated to become identical with the other.</p><p>Note that mirroring a shape is not allowed. Also note that the order of points matters: the shape $$$(Q_1,\\dots,Q_{n-1},Q_0)$$$ is not necessarily equivalent to the shape $$$(Q_0,\\dots,Q_{n-1})$$$.</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1e8aae1ecc38c27063eba86d8fe57f1aae61ba5f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>In the figure on the left: Shapes $$$U$$$ and $$$V$$$ are equivalent. Shape $$$W$$$ is not equivalent with them because the points of $$$W$$$ are given in a different order. Regardless of the order of points, the fourth shape is not equivalent with the previous ones either as flipping a shape is not allowed.</p><p>In both input and output, a shape with $$$n$$$ points is represented as a single line that contains $$$2n+1$$$ space-separated numbers: the number $$$n$$$ followed by the coordinates of the points: $$$Q_{0,x}$$$, $$$Q_{0,y}$$$, $$$Q_{1,x}$$$, ...</p><p>Shapes have <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">identification numbers</span> (IDs). The given shape $$$S$$$ has ID 0, the shapes you produce in your solutions are given IDs 1, 2, 3, ..., in the order in which they are produced.</p><p>Shapes $$$B_1,\\dots,B_k$$$ form a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">subdivision</span> of shape $$$A$$$ if: </p><ul> <li> The union of all $$$P(B_i)$$$ is exactly $$$P(A)$$$. </li><li> For each $$$i\\neq j$$$, the area of the intersection of $$$P(B_i)$$$ and $$$P(B_j)$$$ is zero. </li></ul><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">scissors</span> operation destroys one existing shape $$$A$$$ and produces one or more shapes $$$B_1,\\dots,B_k$$$ that form a subdivision of $$$A$$$.</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/efab2d026ee940060c25f7c719c7876f765abfd1.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>In the figure: Shape $$$A$$$ (square) subdivided into shapes $$$B_1$$$, $$$B_2$$$, $$$B_3$$$ (the three triangles). One valid way to describe one of the $$$B_i$$$ is \"3 3 1 6 1 5.1 4\".</p><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">tape</span> operation destroys one or more existing shapes $$$A_1,\\dots,A_k$$$ and produces one new shape $$$B$$$. In order to perform this operation, you must first specify shapes $$$C_1,\\dots,C_k$$$ and only then the final shape $$$B$$$. These shapes must satisfy the following: </p><ul> <li> For each $$$i$$$, the shape $$$C_i$$$ is equivalent to the shape $$$A_i$$$. </li><li> The shapes $$$C_1,\\dots,C_k$$$ form a subdivision of the shape $$$B$$$. </li></ul><p>Informally, you choose the shape $$$B$$$ and show how to move each of the existing $$$A_i$$$ to its correct location $$$C_i$$$ within $$$B$$$.
