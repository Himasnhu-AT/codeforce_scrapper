In the game, there is only one deck of cards, consisting of $$$a$$$ \"draw $$$0$$$\" cards, $$$b$$$ \"draw $$$1$$$\" cards, $$$c$$$ \"draw $$$2$$$\" cards, and $$$5$$$ special cards. At the start of the game, all cards are in the randomly shuffled deck.</p><p>Bessie starts the game by drawing the top $$$5$$$ cards of the deck. She may then play \"draw $$$x$$$\" cards from the hand to draw the next $$$x$$$ cards from the top of the deck. Note that every card can only be played once, special cards cannot be played, and if Bessie uses a \"draw $$$2$$$\" card when there is only $$$1$$$ card remaining in the deck, then she simply draws that remaining card. Bessie wins if she draws all $$$5$$$ special cards. </p><p>Since Bessie is not very good at math problems, she wants you to find the probability that she wins, given that the deck is shuffled randomly over all $$$(a + b + c + 5)!$$$ possible orderings. It can be shown that this answer can always be expressed as a fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$ where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are coprime integers. Output $$$p \\cdot q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
