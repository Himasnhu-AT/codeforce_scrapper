Interestingly, the \"Top Reindeer\" title is just a measure of upvotes and has nothing to do with their skill level in the reindeer games, but they still give it the utmost importance.</p><p>Currently, the $$$i$$$-th reindeer has a score of $$$a_i$$$. You would like to influence the leaderboard with some operations. In an operation, you can choose a reindeer, and either increase or decrease his score by $$$1$$$ unit. Negative scores are allowed.</p><p>You have $$$m$$$ requirements for the resulting scores. Each requirement is given by an ordered pair $$$(u, v)$$$, meaning that after all operations, the score of reindeer $$$u$$$ must be less than or equal to the score of reindeer $$$v$$$.</p><p>Your task is to perform the minimum number of operations so that all requirements will be satisfied.</p>",
