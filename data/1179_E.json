It's an notorious coincidence that $$$n$$$ is a divisor of $$$L$$$. </p><p>She suggests Alesya a game. Using one question Alesya can ask Tanya a value of any single function in any single point. To win Alesya must choose integers $$$l_{i}$$$ and $$$r_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \\leq l_{i} \\leq r_{i} \\leq 10^{18}$$$), such that $$$f_{i}(r_{i}) - f_{i}(l_{i}) \\geq \\frac{L}{n}$$$ (here $$$f_i(x)$$$ means the value of $$$i$$$-th function at point $$$x$$$) for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ so that for any pair of two functions their segments $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ don't intersect (but may have one common point).</p><p>Unfortunately, Tanya doesn't allow to make more than $$$2 \\cdot 10^{5}$$$ questions. Help Alesya to win!</p><p>It can be proved that it's always possible to choose $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ which satisfy the conditions described above.</p><p>It's guaranteed, that Tanya doesn't change functions during the game, i.e. interactor is not adaptive</p>",
