    "statement": "<p>Cowboy Beblop is a funny little boy who likes sitting at his computer. He somehow obtained two elastic hoops in the shape of 2D polygons, which are not necessarily convex. Since there's no gravity on his spaceship, the hoops are standing still in the air. Since the hoops are very elastic, Cowboy Beblop can stretch, rotate, translate or shorten their edges as much as he wants.</p><p>For both hoops, you are given the number of their vertices, as well as the position of each vertex, defined by the X , Y and Z coordinates. The vertices are given in the order they're connected: the 1st\u202fvertex is connected to the 2nd, which is connected to the 3rd, etc., and the last vertex is connected to the first one. Two hoops are connected if it's impossible to pull them to infinity in different directions by manipulating their edges, without having their edges or vertices intersect at any point \u2013 <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">just like when two links of a chain are connected</span>. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">The polygons' edges do not intersect or overlap</span>. </p><p>To make things easier, we say that two polygons are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">well-connected</span>, if the edges of one polygon cross the area of the other polygon in two different directions (from the upper and lower sides of the plane defined by that polygon) a different number of times.</p><p>Cowboy Beblop is fascinated with the hoops he has obtained and he would like to know whether they are well-connected or not. Since he\u2019s busy playing with his dog, Zwei, he\u2019d like you to figure it out for him. He promised you some sweets if you help him! </p>",
