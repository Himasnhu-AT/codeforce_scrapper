    "statement": "<p>Polycarp must pay <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$n$$$ burles at the checkout. He has coins of two nominal values: $$$1$$$ burle and $$$2$$$ burles. Polycarp likes both kinds of coins equally. So he doesn't want to pay with more coins of one type than with the other.</p><p>Thus, Polycarp wants to minimize the difference between the count of coins of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$2$$$ burles being used. Help him by determining two non-negative integer values $$$c_1$$$ and $$$c_2$$$ which are the number of coins of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$2$$$ burles, respectively, so that the total value of that number of coins is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$n$$$ (i.\u2009e. $$$c_1 + 2 \\cdot c_2 = n$$$), and the absolute value of the difference between $$$c_1$$$ and $$$c_2$$$ is as little as possible (i.\u2009e. you must minimize $$$|c_1-c_2|$$$).</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case consists of one line. This line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^9$$$) \u2014 the number of burles to be paid by Polycarp.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output a separate line containing two integers $$$c_1$$$ and $$$c_2$$$ ($$$c_1, c_2 \\ge 0$$$) separated by a space where $$$c_1$$$ is the number of coins of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$c_2$$$ is the number of coins of $$$2$$$ burles.

The sum of the nominal values of all coins is $$$334 \\cdot 1 + 333 \\cdot 2 = 1000$$$, whereas $$$|334 - 333| = 1$$$. One can't get the better value because if $$$|c_1 - c_2| = 0$$$, then $$$c_1 = c_2$$$ and $$$c_1 \\cdot 1 + c_1 \\cdot 2 = 1000$$$, but then the value of $$$c_1$$$ isn't an integer.</p><p>The answer for the second test case is \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10 10</span>\". The sum of the nominal values is $$$10 \\cdot 1 + 10 \\cdot 2 = 30$$$ and $$$|10 - 10| = 0$$$, whereas there's no number having an absolute value less than $$$0$$$.</p>",
