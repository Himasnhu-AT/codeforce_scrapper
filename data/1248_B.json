    "statement": "<p>Gardener Alexey teaches competitive programming to high school students. To congratulate Alexey on the Teacher's Day, the students have gifted him a collection of wooden sticks, where every stick has an integer length. Now Alexey wants to grow a tree from them.</p><p>The tree looks like a polyline on the plane, consisting of all sticks. The polyline starts at the point $$$(0, 0)$$$. While constructing the polyline, Alexey will attach sticks to it one by one in arbitrary order. Each stick must be either vertical or horizontal (that is, parallel to $$$OX$$$ or $$$OY$$$ axis). It is not allowed for two consecutive sticks to be aligned simultaneously horizontally or simultaneously vertically. See the images below for clarification.</p><p>Alexey wants to make a polyline in such a way that its end is as far as possible from $$$(0, 0)$$$. Please help him to grow the tree this way.</p><p>Note that the polyline defining the form of the tree may have self-intersections and self-touches, but it can be proved that the optimal answer does not contain any self-intersections or self-touches.</p>",
