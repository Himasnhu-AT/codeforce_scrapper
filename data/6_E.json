    "statement": "<p>There are several days left before the fiftieth birthday of a famous Berland's writer Berlbury. In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> millimeters.</p><p>The library has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.</p>",
