After he reaches an arbitrary detachment, he can repeat the same process.</p><p>Each $$$t$$$ seconds an orbital strike covers the whole surface, so at that moment Brimstone should be in a point where some detachment is located. He can stay with any detachment as long as needed.</p><p>Brimstone is a good commander, that's why he can create <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most one</span> detachment and place it in any empty point with integer coordinates he wants before his trip.
