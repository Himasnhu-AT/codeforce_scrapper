Initially, all vertices are white. </p><p>There are two chess pieces called $$$P_A$$$ and $$$P_B$$$ on the tree. $$$P_A$$$ and $$$P_B$$$ are initially located on vertices $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively. In one step, 378QAQ will do the following in order:</p><ol> <li> Move $$$P_A$$$ to a neighboring vertex. If the target vertex is white, this vertex will be painted red. </li><li> Move $$$P_B$$$ to a neighboring vertex. If the target vertex is colored in red, this vertex will be painted blue. </li></ol><p>Initially, the vertex $$$a$$$ is painted red. If $$$a=b$$$, the vertex $$$a$$$ is painted blue instead. Note that both the chess pieces <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">must</span> be moved in each step. Two pieces can be on the same vertex at any given time.</p><p>378QAQ wants to know the minimum number of steps to paint all vertices blue.</p>",
