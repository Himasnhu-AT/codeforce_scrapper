The problem of the day reads:</span></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>You are given an integer $$$c$$$. Suppose that $$$c$$$ has $$$n$$$ divisors. You have to find a sequence with $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$[a_1, a_2, ... a_{n - 1}]$$$, which satisfies the following conditions:</p><ul> <li> Each element is strictly greater than $$$1$$$. </li><li> Each element is a divisor of $$$c$$$. </li><li> All elements are distinct. </li><li> For all $$$1 \\le i &lt; n - 1$$$, $$$\\gcd(a_i, a_{i + 1})$$$ is a prime number. </li></ul><p>In this problem, because $$$c$$$ can be too big, the result of prime factorization of $$$c$$$ is given instead. Note that $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ and a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly $$$2$$$ divisors.</p>",
