Today he found one he wasn't able to solve himself, so he asks you to help.</p><p>Vasiliy is given <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> strings consisting of lowercase English letters. He wants them to be sorted in lexicographical order (as in the dictionary), but he is not allowed to swap any of them. The only operation he is allowed to do is to reverse any of them (first character becomes last, second becomes one before last and so on).</p><p>To reverse the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th string Vasiliy has to spent <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> units of energy. He is interested in the minimum amount of energy he has to spent in order to have strings sorted in lexicographical order.</p><p>String <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> is lexicographically smaller than string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> if it is shorter than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">|<i>A</i>|\u2009&lt;\u2009|<i>B</i>|</span>) and is its prefix, or if none of them is a prefix of the other and at the first position where they differ character in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> is smaller than the character in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span>.</p><p>For the purpose of this problem, two equal strings nearby do not break the condition of sequence being sorted lexicographically.</p>",
