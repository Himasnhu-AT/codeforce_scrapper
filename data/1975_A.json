In other words, let $$$a=x+y$$$. Then, we can set $$$a:= y+x$$$. Here $$$+$$$ denotes the array concatenation operation. </li></ul><p>For example, if $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5]$$$, we can choose $$$x=[3,1]$$$ and $$$y=[4,1,5]$$$, satisfying $$$a=x+y$$$. Then, we can set $$$a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1]$$$. We can also choose $$$x=[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ and $$$y=[\\,]$$$, satisfying $$$a=x+y$$$. Then, we can set $$$a := y+x = [3,1,4,1,5]$$$. Note that we are not allowed to choose $$$x=[3,1,1]$$$ and $$$y=[4,5]$$$, neither are we allowed to choose $$$x=[1,3]$$$ and $$$y=[5,1,4]$$$, as both these choices do not satisfy $$$a=x+y$$$.</p>",
