There are $$$m$$$ barricades between the castle and the dragon.</p><p>The warriors are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th warrior knows $$$k_i$$$ attacks: the $$$j$$$-th of them deals $$$a_{i,j}$$$ damage to the dragon and can only be applied if there are exactly $$$b_{i,j}$$$ barricades between the castle and the dragon.</p><p>The warriors make turns one after another, starting from warrior $$$1$$$. After warrior $$$n$$$ makes his turn, the total damage to the dragon is calculated. The $$$i$$$-th warrior performs exactly one of three possible moves in his turn:</p><ol> <li> destroys one barricade (if there are any left); </li><li> deploys one of his $$$k_i$$$ attacks; </li><li> skips a turn. </li></ol><p>The total damage is the sum of damages dealt by the warriors who chose to deploy their attacks in their turn.
