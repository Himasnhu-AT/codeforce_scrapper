    "statement": "<p>You are given some Tetris field consisting of $$$n$$$ columns. The initial height of the $$$i$$$-th column of the field is $$$a_i$$$ blocks. On top of these columns you can place <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">only</span> figures of size $$$2 \\times 1$$$ (i.e. the height of this figure is $$$2$$$ blocks and the width of this figure is $$$1$$$ block). Note that you <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">cannot</span> rotate these figures.</p><p>Your task is to say if you can clear the whole field by placing such figures.</p><p>More formally, the problem can be described like this:</p><p>The following process occurs while <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least one $$$a_i$$$ is greater than $$$0$$$</span>:</p><ol> <li> You place one figure $$$2 \\times 1$$$ (choose some $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i + 2$$$); </li><li> then, while all $$$a_i$$$ are greater than zero, replace each $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i - 1$$$. </li></ol><p>And your task is to determine if it is possible to clear the whole field (i.e. finish the described process), choosing the places for new figures properly.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The next $$$2t$$$ lines describe test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the number of columns in the Tetris field. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the initial height of the $$$i$$$-th column of the Tetris field.</p>",

Note that the field has no upper bound.</p><p>One of the correct answers is to first place the figure in the first column. Then after the second step of the process, the field becomes $$$[2, 0, 2]$$$. Then place the figure in the second column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$.</p><p>And the second test case of the example field is shown below:</p><p><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9e670fa3eabfebd5ecdfa6085157f1f4ccfe494e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></p><p>It can be shown that you cannot do anything to end the process.</p><p>In the third test case of the example, you first place the figure in the second column after the second step of the process, the field becomes $$$[0, 2]$$$. Then place the figure in the first column and after the second step of the process, the field becomes $$$[0, 0]$$$.</p><p>In the fourth test case of the example, place the figure in the first column, then the field becomes $$$[102]$$$ after the first step of the process, and then the field becomes $$$[0]$$$ after the second step of the process.</p>",
