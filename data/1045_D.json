    "statement": "<p>In the intergalactic empire Bubbledom there are $$$N$$$ planets, of which some pairs are directly connected by two-way wormholes. There are $$$N-1$$$ wormholes. The wormholes are of extreme religious importance in Bubbledom, a set of planets in Bubbledom consider themselves one intergalactic kingdom if and only if any two planets in the set can reach each other by traversing the wormholes. You are given that Bubbledom is one kingdom. <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">In other words, the network of planets and wormholes is a tree.</span></p><p>However, Bubbledom is facing a powerful enemy also possessing teleportation technology. The enemy attacks every night, and the government of Bubbledom retakes all the planets during the day. In a single attack, the enemy attacks every planet of Bubbledom at once, but some planets are more resilient than others. Planets are number $$$0,1,\u2026,N-1$$$ and the planet $$$i$$$ will fall with probability $$$p_i$$$. Before every night (including the very first one), the government reinforces or weakens the defenses of a single planet.</p><p>The government of Bubbledom is interested in the following question: what is the expected number of intergalactic kingdoms Bubbledom will be split into, after a single enemy attack (before they get a chance to rebuild)? <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">In other words, you need to print the expected number of connected components after every attack.</span></p>",
