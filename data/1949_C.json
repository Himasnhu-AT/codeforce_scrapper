You can tell all the ants currently at house $$$u$$$ to move to house $$$v$$$ if there is a branch directly connecting those two houses. However, the ants ignore your command if there are fewer ants gathered in house $$$v$$$ than in house $$$u$$$, i.e., if it would be easier for the ants from house $$$v$$$ to move. This even holds true if no ant at all is currently in house $$$v$$$.
