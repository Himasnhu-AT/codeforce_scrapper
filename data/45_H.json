    "statement": "<p>The Berland capital (as you very well know) contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> junctions, some pairs of which are connected by two-way roads. Unfortunately, the number of traffic jams in the capital has increased dramatically, that's why it was decided to build several new roads. Every road should connect two junctions. </p><p>The city administration noticed that in the cities of all the developed countries between any two roads one can drive along at least two paths so that the paths don't share any roads (but they may share the same junction). The administration decided to add the minimal number of roads so that this rules was fulfilled in the Berland capital as well. In the city road network should exist no more than one road between every pair of junctions before or after the reform.</p>",
