    "statement": "<p>In a far away land, there are two cities near a river. One day, the cities decide that they have too little space and would like to reclaim some of the river area into land.</p><p>The river area can be represented by a grid with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> rows and exactly two columns \u2014 each cell represents a rectangular area. The rows are numbered <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> through <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> from top to bottom, while the columns are numbered <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>.</p><p>Initially, all of the cells are occupied by the river. The plan is to turn some of those cells into land one by one, with the cities alternately choosing a cell to reclaim, and continuing until no more cells can be reclaimed.</p><p>However, the river is also used as a major trade route. The cities need to make sure that ships will still be able to sail from one end of the river to the other. More formally, if a cell <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>,\u2009<i>c</i>)</span> has been reclaimed, it is not allowed to reclaim any of the cells <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>\u2009-\u20091,\u20093\u2009-\u2009<i>c</i>)</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>,\u20093\u2009-\u2009<i>c</i>)</span>, or <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>r</i>\u2009+\u20091,\u20093\u2009-\u2009<i>c</i>)</span>.</p><p>The cities are not on friendly terms, and each city wants to be the last city to reclaim a cell (they don't care about how many cells they reclaim, just who reclaims a cell last). The cities have already reclaimed <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cells. Your job is to determine which city will be the last to reclaim a cell, assuming both choose cells optimally from current moment.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line consists of two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>r</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009100,\u20090\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>r</i></span>). Then <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines follow, describing the cells that were already reclaimed. Each line consists of two integers: <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>r</i>,\u20091\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009\u2264\u20092</span>), which represent the cell located at row <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>r</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and column <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. All of the lines describing the cells will be distinct, and the reclaimed cells will not violate the constraints above.</p>",
