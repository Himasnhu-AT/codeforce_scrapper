    "statement": "<p>A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">round</span> if it is of the form <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">d00...0</span>. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ (inclusive) are round.</p><p>For example, the following numbers are round: $$$4000$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$800$$$, $$$90$$$. The following numbers are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> round: $$$110$$$, $$$707$$$, $$$222$$$, $$$1001$$$.</p><p>You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$). Represent the number $$$n$$$ as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number $$$n$$$ as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer $$$k$$$ \u2014 the minimum number of summands. Next, $$$k$$$ terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is $$$n$$$. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.</p>",
