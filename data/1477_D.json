    "statement": "<p>Nezzar designs a brand new game \"Hidden Permutations\" and shares it with his best friend, Nanako.</p><p>At the beginning of the game, Nanako and Nezzar both know integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. The game goes in the following way:</p><ul> <li> Firstly, Nezzar hides two permutations $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ and $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and Nanako secretly selects $$$m$$$ unordered pairs $$$(l_1,r_1),(l_2,r_2),\\ldots,(l_m,r_m)$$$; </li><li> After that, Nanako sends his chosen pairs to Nezzar; </li><li> On receiving those $$$m$$$ unordered pairs, Nezzar checks if there exists $$$1 \\le i \\le m$$$, such that $$$(p_{l_i}-p_{r_i})$$$ and $$$(q_{l_i}-q_{r_i})$$$ have different signs. If so, Nezzar instantly loses the game and gets a score of $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, the score Nezzar gets is equal to the number of indices $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ such that $$$p_i \\neq q_i$$$. </li></ul><p>However, Nezzar accidentally knows Nanako's unordered pairs and decides to take advantage of them. Please help Nezzar find out two permutations $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ such that the score is maximized.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5, 0 \\le m \\le \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},5 \\cdot 10^5)$$$). </p><p>Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i,r_i \\le n$$$, $$$l_i \\neq r_i$$$), describing the $$$i$$$-th unordered pair Nanako chooses. It is guaranteed that all $$$m$$$ unordered pairs are distinct.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, print two permutations $$$p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$$$ and $$$q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_n$$$ such that the score Nezzar gets is maximized.</p>",

Obviously, it is the maximum possible score Nezzar can get.</p>",
