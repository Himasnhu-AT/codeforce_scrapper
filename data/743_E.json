    "statement": "<p>Vladik was bored on his way home and decided to play the following game. He took <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span> written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:</p><ul> <li> the number of occurrences of each number from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">8</span> in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>k</i></sub></span> cards with number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/530978122dd0f1e0d9782b65fe403300a8991cce.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> the condition <span class=\"tex-span\">|<i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>\u2009-\u2009<i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>j</i></sub>|\u2009\u2264\u20091</span> must hold. </li><li> if there is at least one card with number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence</span>). For example, the subsequence <span class=\"tex-span\">[1,\u20091,\u20092,\u20092]</span> satisfies this condition while the subsequence <span class=\"tex-span\">[1,\u20092,\u20092,\u20091]</span> doesn't. Note that <span class=\"tex-span\">[1,\u20091,\u20092,\u20092]</span> doesn't satisfy the first condition. </li></ul><p>Please help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.</p>",
