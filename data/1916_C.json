In honor of this, Masha, for warm-up, suggested playing a game with Olya:</p><p>There is an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Masha goes first, and the players take turns. Each move is described by the following sequence of actions:</p><p>$$$\\bullet$$$ If the size of the array is $$$1$$$, the game ends.</p><p>$$$\\bullet$$$ The player who is currently playing chooses two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le |a|$$$), and performs the following operation\u00a0\u2014 removes $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array and adds to the array a number equal to $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i + a_j}{2} \\rfloor \\cdot 2$$$. In other words, first divides the sum of the numbers $$$a_i$$$, $$$a_j$$$ by $$$2$$$ rounding down, and then multiplies the result by $$$2$$$.</p><p>Masha aims to maximize the final number, while Olya aims to minimize it.</p><p>Masha and Olya decided to play on each non-empty prefix of the initial array $$$a$$$, and asked for your help.</p><p>For each $$$k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$, answer the following question. Let only the first $$$k$$$ elements of the array $$$a$$$ be present in the game, with indices $$$1, 2, \\ldots, k$$$ respectively. What number will remain at the end with optimal play by both players?</p>",
