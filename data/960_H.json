    "statement": "<p>Santa has an infinite number of candies for each of $$$m$$$ flavours. You are given a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices. The root of the tree is the vertex $$$1$$$. Each vertex contains exactly one candy. The $$$i$$$-th vertex has a candy of flavour $$$f_i$$$.</p><p>Sometimes Santa fears that candies of flavour $$$k$$$ have melted. He chooses any vertex $$$x$$$ randomly and sends the subtree of $$$x$$$ to the Bakers for a replacement. In a replacement, all the candies with flavour $$$k$$$ are replaced with a new candy of the same flavour. The candies which are not of flavour $$$k$$$ are left unchanged. After the replacement, the tree is restored.</p><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">actual</span> cost of replacing one candy of flavour $$$k$$$ is $$$c_k$$$ (given for each $$$k$$$). The Baker keeps the price fixed in order to make calculation simple. Every time when a subtree comes for a replacement, the Baker charges $$$C$$$, no matter which subtree it is and which flavour it is.</p><p>Suppose that for a given flavour $$$k$$$ the probability that Santa chooses a vertex for replacement is same for all the vertices. You need to find out the expected value of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">error</span> in calculating the cost of replacement of flavour $$$k$$$. The error in calculating the cost is defined as follows.</p><p>$$$$$$ Error\\ E(k) =\\ (Actual Cost\\ \u2013\\ Price\\ charged\\ by\\ the\\ Bakers) ^ 2.$$$$$$</p><p>Note that the actual cost is the cost of replacement of one candy of the flavour $$$k$$$ multiplied by the number of candies in the subtree.</p><p>Also, sometimes Santa may wish to replace a candy at vertex $$$x$$$ with a candy of some flavour from his pocket.</p><p>You need to handle two types of operations: </p><ul> <li> Change the flavour of the candy at vertex $$$x$$$ to $$$w$$$. </li><li> Calculate the expected value of error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $$$k$$$. </li></ul>",

Two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$w$$$ follow ($$$1\u2009\\leqslant \u2009x \\leqslant \u2009n$$$, $$$1 \\leqslant \u2009w \\leqslant\u2009m$$$), it means that Santa replaces the candy at vertex $$$x$$$ with flavour $$$w$$$.</p><p>Otherwise, if $$$t = 2$$$, the line describes a query of the second type and an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1\u2009\\leqslant\u2009k\u2009\\leqslant\u2009m$$$) follows, it means that you should print the expected value of the error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $$$k$$$.</p><p>The vertices are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.
