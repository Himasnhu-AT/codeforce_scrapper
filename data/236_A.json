    "statement": "<p>Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. </p><p>But yesterday, he came to see \"her\" in the real world and found out \"she\" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.</p><p>This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters \u2014 the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>If it is a female by our hero's method, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">CHAT WITH HER!</span>\" (without the quotes), otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">IGNORE HIM!</span>\" (without the quotes).</p>",

    "note": "<p>For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">wjmzbmr</span>\". These characters are: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">w</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">j</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">m</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">r</span>\". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">CHAT WITH HER!</span>\".</p>",
