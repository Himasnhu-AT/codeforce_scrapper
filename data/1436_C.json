    "statement": "<p>Andrey thinks he is truly a successful developer, but in reality he didn't know about the binary search algorithm until recently. After reading some literature Andrey understood that this algorithm allows to quickly find a certain number $$$x$$$ in an array. For an array $$$a$$$ indexed from zero, and an integer $$$x$$$ the pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3764416c1f68d285741d1417ea47dc5bbce173e2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Note that the elements of the array are indexed from zero, and the division is done in integers (rounding down).</p><p>Andrey read that the algorithm only works if the array is sorted. However, he found this statement untrue, because there certainly exist unsorted arrays for which the algorithm find $$$x$$$!</p><p>Andrey wants to write a letter to the book authors, but before doing that he must consider the permutations of size $$$n$$$ such that the algorithm finds $$$x$$$ in them. A permutation of size $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order.</p><p>Help Andrey and find the number of permutations of size $$$n$$$ which contain $$$x$$$ at position $$$pos$$$ and for which the given implementation of the binary search algorithm finds $$$x$$$ (returns true). As the result may be extremely large, print the remainder of its division by $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>",
