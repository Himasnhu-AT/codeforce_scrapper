    "statement": "<p>These days Arkady works as an air traffic controller at a large airport. He controls a runway which is usually used for landings only. Thus, he has a schedule of planes that are landing in the nearest future, each landing lasts $$$1$$$ minute.</p><p>He was asked to insert one takeoff in the schedule. The takeoff takes $$$1$$$ minute itself, but for safety reasons there should be a time space between the takeoff and any landing of at least $$$s$$$ minutes from both sides.</p><p>Find the earliest time when Arkady can insert the takeoff.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le s \\le 60$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of landings on the schedule and the minimum allowed time (in minutes) between a landing and a takeoff.</p><p>Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \\le h \\le 23$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 59$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the time, in hours and minutes, when a plane will land, starting from current moment (i.\u00a0e. the current time is $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$).
