The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is poured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and around the bun, as in the following picture:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/883110c5011d3c0b7480d539e73ab22ba73d6db0.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/><p> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Cinnabon rolls of sizes 4, 5, 6</span> </p></center><p>For a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$, the length of the outer side of the square is $$$n$$$, and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment in the central part is one.</p><p>Formally, the bun consists of two dough spirals separated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size $$$n + 1$$$ is obtained from a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$ by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the cinnabon roll for another layer.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">It is important that a cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$ is defined in a unique way.</span></p><p>Tema is interested in how much chocolate is in his cinnabon roll of size $$$n$$$.
