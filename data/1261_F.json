Each number should be counted only once.</p><p>For example, if $$$A = \\{2, 3\\}$$$ and $$$B = \\{2, 3\\}$$$ you should count integer $$$1$$$ only once, despite the fact that you can get it as $$$3 \\oplus 2$$$ and as $$$2 \\oplus 3$$$. So the answer for this case is equal to $$$1 + 0 = 1$$$.</p><p>Let's call a segment $$$[l; r]$$$ a set of integers $$$\\{l, l+1, \\dots, r\\}$$$.</p><p>The set $$$A$$$ is given as a union of $$$n_A$$$ segments, the set $$$B$$$ is given as a union of $$$n_B$$$ segments.</p>",
