    "statement": "<p>Formula One championship consists of series of races called Grand Prix. After every race drivers receive points according to their final position. Only the top 10 drivers receive points in the following order 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. At the conclusion of the championship the driver with most points is the champion. If there is a tie, champion is the one with most wins (i.e. first places). If a tie still exists, it is chosen the one with most second places, and so on, until there are no more place to use for compare.</p><p> Last year another scoring system was proposed but rejected. In it the champion is the one with most wins. If there is tie, champion is the one with most points. If a tie still exists it is proceeded the same way as in the original scoring system, that is comparing number of second, third, forth, and so on, places.</p><p>You are given the result of all races during the season and you are to determine the champion according to both scoring systems. It is guaranteed, that both systems will produce unique champion.</p>",
