    "statement": "<p>Erelong Leha was bored by calculating of the greatest common divisor of two factorials. Therefore he decided to solve some crosswords. It's well known that it is a very interesting occupation though it can be very difficult from time to time. In the course of solving one of the crosswords, Leha had to solve a simple task. You are able to do it too, aren't you?</p><p>Leha has two strings <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. The hacker wants to change the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> at such way, that it can be found in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> as a substring. All the changes should be the following: Leha chooses one position in the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> and replaces the symbol in this position with the question mark \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>\". The hacker is sure that the question mark in comparison can play the role of an arbitrary symbol. For example, if he gets string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>=\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ab?b</span>\" as a result, it will appear in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>=\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aabrbb</span>\" as a substring.</p><p>Guaranteed that the length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> doesn't exceed the length of the string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span>. Help the hacker to replace in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> as few symbols as possible so that the result of the replacements can be found in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> as a substring. The symbol \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>\" should be considered equal to any other symbol.</p>",

Print the positions in any order. If there are several solutions print any of them. The numbering of the positions begins from one.</p>",
