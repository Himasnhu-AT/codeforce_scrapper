After long economic calculations was decided that the most expensive coin should possess the denomination of exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> Berland dollars. Also the following restriction has been introduced for comfort: the denomination of each coin <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">should be divisible</span> by the denomination of any cheaper coin. It is known that among all the possible variants the variant with the largest number of new coins will be chosen. Find this variant. Print in the order of decreasing of the coins' denominations.</p>",

The number of coins must be the largest possible (with the given denomination <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> of the most expensive coin). Also, the denomination of every coin must be divisible by the denomination of any cheaper coin. Naturally, the denominations of all the coins should be different.
