The citizens' surnames are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>k</i></sub></span>. All surnames are different. Initially all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> citizens from this list are members of the government. The system should support the following options:</p><ul> <li> Include citizen <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> to the government. </li><li> Exclude citizen <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> from the government. </li><li> Given a newspaper article text, calculate how politicized it is. To do this, for every active government member the system counts the number of times his surname occurs in the text as a substring. All occurrences are taken into consideration, including the intersecting ones. The degree of politicization of a text is defined as the sum of these values for all active government members. </li></ul><p>Implement this system.</p>",
