    "statement": "<p>Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/cf667d5378aa3553058e0b348b30c37378759ffd.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>, in particular that <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup>\u2009=\u2009<i>q</i>\u2009+\u20091</span>, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it \"golden system\". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">0</sub><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>...<i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>n</i></sub></span> equals to <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/51c20c3ef1a1e517fd60f28ab2fdea1fd54d65c7.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>.</p><p>Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.</p><p>Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">&gt;</span>\" if the first number is larger, \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">&lt;</span>\" if it is smaller and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">=</span>\" if they are equal.</p>",
