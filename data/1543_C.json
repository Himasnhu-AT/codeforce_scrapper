    "statement": "<p>After defeating a Blacklist Rival, you get a chance to draw $$$1$$$ reward slip out of $$$x$$$ hidden valid slips. Initially, $$$x=3$$$ and these hidden valid slips are Cash Slip, Impound Strike Release Marker and Pink Slip of Rival's Car. Initially, the probability of drawing these in a random guess are $$$c$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$p$$$, respectively. There is also a volatility factor $$$v$$$. You can play any number of Rival Races as long as you don't draw a Pink Slip. Assume that you win each race and get a chance to draw a reward slip. In each draw, you draw one of the $$$x$$$ valid items with their respective probabilities. Suppose you draw a particular item and its probability of drawing before the draw was $$$a$$$. Then,</p><ul> <li> If the item was a Pink Slip, the quest is over, and you will not play any more races. </li><li> Otherwise, <ol> <li> If $$$a\\leq v$$$, the probability of the item drawn becomes $$$0$$$ and the item is no longer a valid item for all the further draws, reducing $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$. Moreover, the reduced probability $$$a$$$ is distributed equally among the other remaining valid items. </li><li> If $$$a &gt; v$$$, the probability of the item drawn reduces by $$$v$$$ and the reduced probability is distributed equally among the other valid items. </li></ol> </li></ul><p>For example,</p><ul> <li> If $$$(c,m,p)=(0.2,0.1,0.7)$$$ and $$$v=0.1$$$, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be $$$(0.1,0.15,0.75)$$$. </li><li> If $$$(c,m,p)=(0.1,0.2,0.7)$$$ and $$$v=0.2$$$, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be $$$(Invalid,0.25,0.75)$$$. </li><li> If $$$(c,m,p)=(0.2,Invalid,0.8)$$$ and $$$v=0.1$$$, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be $$$(0.1,Invalid,0.9)$$$. </li><li> If $$$(c,m,p)=(0.1,Invalid,0.9)$$$ and $$$v=0.2$$$, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be $$$(Invalid,Invalid,1.0)$$$. </li></ul><p>You need the cars of Rivals. So, you need to find the expected number of races that you must play in order to draw a pink slip.</p>",
