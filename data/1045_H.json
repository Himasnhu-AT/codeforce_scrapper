    "statement": "<p>Being bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of \u2014 binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in $$$c_{00}$$$, $$$c_{01}$$$, $$$c_{10}$$$ and $$$c_{11}$$$, representing how many times substrings <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">01</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">11</span> appear in the number respectively. For example:</p><p> $$$10111100 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 1, \\ c_{01} = 1,\\ c_{10} = 2,\\ c_{11} = 3$$$</p><p> $$$10000 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 3,\\ c_{01} = 0,\\ c_{10} = 1,\\ c_{11} = 0$$$</p><p> $$$10101001 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 1,\\ c_{01} = 3,\\ c_{10} = 3,\\ c_{11} = 0$$$</p><p> $$$1 \\rightarrow c_{00} = 0,\\ c_{01} = 0,\\ c_{10} = 0,\\ c_{11} = 0$$$</p><p>Wall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same $$$c_{00}$$$, $$$c_{01}$$$, $$$c_{10}$$$ and $$$c_{11}$$$ constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints $$$c_{xy}$$$ given the interval $$$[A, B]$$$. Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.</p>",
