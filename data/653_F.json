    "statement": "<p>Alex was programming while Valentina (his toddler daughter) got there and started asking many questions about the round brackets (or parenthesis) in the code. He explained her a bit and when she got it he gave her a task in order to finish his code on time.</p><p>For the purpose of this problem we consider only strings consisting of opening and closing round brackets, that is characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(</span>' and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)</span>'.</p><p>The sequence of brackets is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">correct</span> if: </p><ol> <li> it's empty; </li><li> it's a correct sequence of brackets, enclosed in a pair of opening and closing brackets; </li><li> it's a concatenation of two correct sequences of brackets. </li></ol><p>For example, the sequences \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">()()</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">((()))(())</span>\" are correct, while \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">)(()</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">(((((</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">())</span>\" are not.</p><p>Alex took a piece of paper, wrote a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> consisting of brackets and asked Valentina to count the number of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> non-empty substrings of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> that are correct sequences of brackets. In other words, her task is to count the number of non-empty correct sequences of brackets that occur in a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> as a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">substring</span> (don't mix up with subsequences).</p><p>When Valentina finished the task, Alex noticed he doesn't know the answer.
