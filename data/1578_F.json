    "statement": "<p>Life has been discovered on Venus! What is more, the life forms appear to be convex polygons. An international consortium is designing a probe to send to Venus to take pictures, but they need to estimate the bandwidth needed to send back pictures.</p><p>When the probe takes a picture of a life form and wishes to send it back to Earth, the bandwidth required is proportional to the area of the bounding box (in other words, the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains the life-form). The shape and size of the life forms are known, but the orientation relative to the camera is random. You must thus determine the <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">expected</span> (average) area of the bounding box across all orientations.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The input describes the shape of a life form as a convex polygon in two dimensions.</p><p>The first line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices. The remaining $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of a vertex. The vertices are given in counterclockwise order, and no three vertices lie on a straight line.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Output a single line containing the expected area of the bounding box of the polygon. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $$$10^{-6}$$$.</p>",
