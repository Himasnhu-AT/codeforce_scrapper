    "statement": "<p>Vasya has recently bought some land and decided to surround it with a wooden fence.</p><p>He went to a company called \"Wooden board\" that produces wooden boards for fences. Vasya read in the catalog of products that the company has at its disposal <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> different types of wood. The company uses the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th type of wood to produce a board of this type that is a rectangular <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> by <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> block.</p><p>Vasya decided to order boards in this company and build a fence from them. It turned out that the storehouse of the company is so large that Vasya can order arbitrary number of boards of every type. Note that Vasya is allowed to <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">turn</span> the boards as he builds the fence. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">However, Vasya cannot turn square boards.</span></p><p>Vasya is required to construct a fence of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span>, however, an arbitrary fence won't do. Vasya wants his fence to look beautiful. We'll say that a fence is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">beautiful</span> if and only if the following two conditions are fulfilled:</p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">there are no</span> two successive boards of the same type </li><li> the first board of the fence has an arbitrary length, and the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">length</span> of each subsequent board equals the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">width</span> of the previous one </li></ul><p>In other words, the fence is considered beautiful, if the type of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th board in the fence is different from the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>-th board's type; besides, the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th board's length is equal to the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>-th board's width (for all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>, starting from 2).</p><p>Now Vasya wonders, how many variants of arranging a fence for his land exist. Your task is to count the number of different beautiful fences of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span>.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Two fences will be considered the same if the corresponding sequences of fence boards types and rotations are the same, otherwise the fences are different.</span> Since the sought number can be large enough, you need to calculate the answer modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">1000000007</span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>\u2009+\u20097)</span>.</p>",
