    "statement": "<p>Ildar is the algorithm teacher of William and Harris. Today, Ildar is teaching Cartesian Tree. However, Harris is sick, so Ildar is only teaching William.</p><p>A cartesian tree is a rooted tree, that can be constructed from a sequence of distinct integers. We build the cartesian tree as follows:</p><ol><li> If the sequence is empty, return an empty tree;</li><li> Let the position of the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximum</span> element be $$$x$$$;</li><li> Remove element on the position $$$x$$$ from the sequence and break it into the left part and the right part (which might be empty) (not actually removing it, just taking it away temporarily);</li><li> Build cartesian tree for each part;</li><li> Create a new vertex for the element, that was on the position $$$x$$$ which will serve as the root of the new tree. Then, for the root of the left part and right part, if exists, will become the children for this vertex;</li><li> Return the tree we have gotten.</li></ol><p>For example, this is the cartesian tree for the sequence $$$4, 2, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1$$$:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f877ecaa038b10e98f7ec812c49db83101751df2.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>After teaching what the cartesian tree is, Ildar has assigned homework. He starts with an empty sequence $$$a$$$.</p><p>In the $$$i$$$-th round, he inserts an element with value $$$i$$$ somewhere in $$$a$$$. Then, he asks a question: what is the sum of the sizes of the subtrees for every node in the cartesian tree for the current sequence $$$a$$$?</p><p>Node $$$v$$$ is in the node $$$u$$$ subtree if and only if $$$v = u$$$ or $$$v$$$ is in the subtree of one of the vertex $$$u$$$ children. The size of the subtree of node $$$u$$$ is the number of nodes $$$v$$$ such that $$$v$$$ is in the subtree of $$$u$$$.</p><p>Ildar will do $$$n$$$ rounds in total. The homework is the sequence of answers to the $$$n$$$ questions.</p><p>The next day, Ildar told Harris that he has to complete the homework as well. Harris obtained the final state of the sequence $$$a$$$ from William. However, he has no idea how to find the answers to the $$$n$$$ questions. Help Harris!</p>",
