Hemose didn't want to do that, as he was playing Valorant, so he came up with a problem and told it to Ahmed to distract him. Sadly, Ahmed can't solve it... Could you help him?</span></p><p>There is an Agent in Valorant, and he has $$$n$$$ weapons. The $$$i$$$-th weapon has a damage value $$$a_i$$$, and the Agent will face an enemy whose health value is $$$H$$$.</p><p>The Agent will perform one or more moves until the enemy dies.</p><p>In one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the enemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will become less than or equal to $$$0$$$. However, not everything is so easy: <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the Agent can't choose the same weapon for $$$2$$$ times in a row</span>.</p><p>What is the minimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy?</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first test case, the Agent can use the second weapon, making health value of the enemy equal to $$$4-7=-3$$$. $$$-3 \\le 0$$$, so the enemy is dead, and using weapon $$$1$$$ time was enough.</p><p>In the second test case, the Agent can use the first weapon first, and then the second one. After this, the health of enemy will drop to $$$6-4-2 = 0$$$, meaning he would be killed after using weapons $$$2$$$ times.</p><p>In the third test case, the Agent can use the weapons in order (third, first, third), decreasing the health value of enemy to $$$11 - 7 - 2 - 7 = -5$$$ after using the weapons $$$3$$$ times. Note that we can't kill the enemy by using the third weapon twice, as even though $$$11-7-7&lt;0$$$, it's not allowed to use the same weapon twice in a row.</p>",
