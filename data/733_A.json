Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">jump ability</span> he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Jump ability</span> is the maximum possible length of his jump. </p><p>Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to the value of his <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">jump ability</span>.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9f468c8e2a165d702e0b35955910a2e841e399d6.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The picture corresponds to the first example.</span> </center><p>The following letters are vowels: '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">E</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">I</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">O</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>' and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Y</span>'.</p>",
