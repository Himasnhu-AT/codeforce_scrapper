He owns $$$n$$$ lights, all of which flash periodically.</p><p>After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Light with parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every $$$a_i$$$ seconds starting from the $$$b_i$$$-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments $$$b_i$$$, $$$b_i + a_i$$$, $$$b_i + 2 \\cdot a_i$$$ and so on.</p><p>You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"302px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5b8ced351fc35747fda01b8c4aba8716b071979e.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"643px\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Here is a graphic for the first example.</span> </center>",
