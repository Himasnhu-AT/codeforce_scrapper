The $$$i$$$-th planet is on the orbit $$$a_i$$$, there could be multiple planets on the same orbit. It's a pity that all the planets are on the way and need to be destructed.</p><p>Vogons have two machines to do that.</p><ul> <li> The first machine in one operation can destroy any planet at cost of $$$1$$$ Triganic Pu. </li><li> The second machine in one operation can destroy all planets on a single orbit in this system at the cost of $$$c$$$ Triganic Pus. </li></ul><p>Vogons can use each machine as many times as they want.</p><p>Vogons are very greedy, so they want to destroy all planets with minimum amount of money spent. Can you help them to know the minimum cost of this project?</p>",
