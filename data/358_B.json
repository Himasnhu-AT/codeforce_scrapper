    "statement": "<p>Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.</p><p>Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the \"less\" characters (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">&lt;</span>) and the digit three (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">3</span>). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: &lt;3<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>word</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span>&lt;3<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>word</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub></span>&lt;3 ... <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>word</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>n</i></sub></span>&lt;3.</p><p>Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs \"more\" and \"less\" into any places of the message.</p><p>Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.</p>",
