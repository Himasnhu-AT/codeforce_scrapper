    "statement": "<p>Wojtek has just won a maths competition in Byteland! The prize is admirable \u2014 a great book called 'Card Tricks for Everyone.' 'Great!' he thought, 'I can finally use this old, dusted deck of cards that's always been lying unused on my desk!'</p><p>The first chapter of the book is 'How to Shuffle $$$k$$$ Cards in Any Order You Want.' It's basically a list of $$$n$$$ intricate methods of shuffling the deck of $$$k$$$ cards in a deterministic way. Specifically, the $$$i$$$-th recipe can be described as a permutation $$$(P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, \\dots, P_{i,k})$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. If we enumerate the cards in the deck from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ from top to bottom, then $$$P_{i,j}$$$ indicates the number of the $$$j$$$-th card from the top of the deck after the shuffle.</p><p>The day is short and Wojtek wants to learn only some of the tricks today. He will pick two integers $$$l, r$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), and he will memorize each trick from the $$$l$$$-th to the $$$r$$$-th, inclusive. He will then take a sorted deck of $$$k$$$ cards and repeatedly apply random memorized tricks until he gets bored. He still likes maths, so he started wondering: how many different decks can he have after he stops shuffling it?</p><p>Wojtek still didn't choose the integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, but he is still curious. Therefore, he defined $$$f(l, r)$$$ as the number of different decks he can get if he memorizes all the tricks between the $$$l$$$-th and the $$$r$$$-th, inclusive. What is the value of</p><p>$$$$$$\\sum_{l=1}^n \\sum_{r=l}^n f(l, r)?$$$$$$</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 200\\,000$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le 5$$$) \u2014 the number of tricks and the number of cards in Wojtek's deck.</p><p>Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines describes a single trick and is described by $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, \\dots, P_{i, k}$$$ ($$$1 \\le P_{i, j} \\le k$$$).</p>",

Therefore, $$$f(1, 1) = f(3, 3) = 2$$$.</p><p>The second trick allows him to shuffle the deck in a cyclic order. Therefore, $$$f(2,2)=3$$$.</p><p>It turns that two first tricks or two last tricks are enough to shuffle the deck in any way desired by Wojtek. Therefore, $$$f(1,2) = f(2,3) = f(1,3) = 3! = 6$$$.</p>",
