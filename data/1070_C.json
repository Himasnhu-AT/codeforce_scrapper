    "statement": "<p>Buber is a Berland technology company that specializes in waste of investor's money. Recently Buber decided to transfer its infrastructure to a cloud. The company decided to rent CPU cores in the cloud for $$$n$$$ consecutive days, which are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Buber requires $$$k$$$ CPU cores each day.</p><p>The cloud provider offers $$$m$$$ tariff plans, the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan is characterized by the following parameters:</p><ul> <li> $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ \u2014 the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan is available only on days from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$, inclusive, </li><li> $$$c_i$$$ \u2014 the number of cores per day available for rent on the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan, </li><li> $$$p_i$$$ \u2014 the price of renting one core per day on the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan. </li></ul><p>Buber can arbitrarily share its computing core needs between the tariff plans. Every day Buber can rent an arbitrary number of cores (from 0 to $$$c_i$$$) on each of the available plans. The number of rented cores on a tariff plan can vary arbitrarily from day to day.</p><p>Find the minimum amount of money that Buber will pay for its work for $$$n$$$ days from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If on a day the total number of cores for all available tariff plans is strictly less than $$$k$$$, then this day Buber will have to work on fewer cores (and it rents all the available cores), otherwise Buber rents exactly $$$k$$$ cores this day.</p>",

Each line contains four integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$, $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le c_i, p_i \\le 10^6$$$), where $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ are starting and finishing days of the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan, $$$c_i$$$ \u2014 number of cores, $$$p_i$$$ \u2014 price of a single core for daily rent on the $$$i$$$-th tariff plan.</p>",
