The balance of some string $$$q$$$ is equal to $$$cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$$$, where $$$cnt_{0, q}$$$ is the number of occurrences of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> in $$$q$$$, and $$$cnt_{1, q}$$$ is the number of occurrences of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span> in $$$q$$$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.</p><p>A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders.
