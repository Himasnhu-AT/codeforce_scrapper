Once she had violated the Beast's order and visited the West Wing. After that she was banished from the castle... </p><p>Everybody was upset. The beautiful Belle was upset, so was the Beast, so was Lumiere the candlestick. But the worst thing was that Cogsworth was upset. Cogsworth is not a human, but is the mantel clock, which was often used as an alarm clock.</p><p>Due to Cogsworth's frustration all the inhabitants of the castle were in trouble: now they could not determine when it was time to drink morning tea, and when it was time for an evening stroll. </p><p>Fortunately, deep in the basement are lying digital clock showing the time in the format <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">HH:MM</span>. Now the residents of the castle face a difficult task. They should turn Cogsworth's hour and minute mustache hands in such a way, that Cogsworth began to show the correct time. Moreover they need to find turn angles in degrees for each mustache hands. The initial time showed by Cogsworth is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">12:00</span>.</p><p>You can only rotate the hands forward, that is, as is shown in the picture: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/9162d7dfc1587716d170ec73e874f93fd914b46f.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>As since there are many ways too select such angles because of full rotations, choose the smallest angles in the right (non-negative) direction.</p><p>Note that Cogsworth's hour and minute mustache hands move evenly and continuously. Hands are moving independently, so when turning one hand the other hand remains standing still.</p>",
