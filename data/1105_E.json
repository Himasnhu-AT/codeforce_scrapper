Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:</p><ul> <li> $$$1$$$\u00a0\u2014 Hiasat can change his handle. </li><li> $$$2$$$ $$$s$$$\u00a0\u2014 friend $$$s$$$ visits Hiasat's profile. </li></ul><p>The friend $$$s$$$ will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be $$$s$$$.</p><p>Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.</p>",

This way, \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">motarack</span>\" and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">light</span>\" will be happy, but \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">mike</span>\" will not.</p><p>In the second example, you can choose either \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">alice</span>\", \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bob</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">tanyaromanova</span>\" and only that friend will be happy.</p>",
