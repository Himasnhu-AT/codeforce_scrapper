    "statement": "<p>Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are too complicated for him \u2014 his keyboard will consist of only one row, where all $$$26$$$ lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.</p><p>Polycarp uses the same password $$$s$$$ on all websites where he is registered (it is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in $$$s$$$, they should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abacaba</span>, then the layout <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cabdefghi...</span> is perfect, since characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span> are adjacent on the keyboard, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span> are adjacent on the keyboard. It is guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in $$$s$$$, so, for example, the password cannot be <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">password</span> (two characters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">s</span> are adjacent).</p><p>Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it is possible?</p>",

Each Latin letter should appear in this string exactly once. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. </li></ul>",
