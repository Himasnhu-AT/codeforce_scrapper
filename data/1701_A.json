In other words, you choose the row $$$x$$$ and the column $$$y$$$, then you cut the grass in all cells $$$a_{x, i}$$$ and all cells $$$a_{i, y}$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$. After you cut the grass from a cell, it becomes empty (i.\u2009e. its value is replaced by $$$0$$$).</p><p>Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to cut the grass in all non-empty cells of the field (i.\u2009e. make all $$$a_{i, j}$$$ zeros).</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p>",
