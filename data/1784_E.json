    "statement": "<p>Alice and Bob are playing an infinite game consisting of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">sets</span>. Each set consists of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">rounds</span>. In each round, one of the players wins. The first player to win two rounds in a set wins this set. Thus, a set always ends with the score of $$$2:0$$$ or $$$2:1$$$ in favor of one of the players.</p><p>Let's call a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">game scenario</span> a finite string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>'. Consider an infinite string formed with repetitions of string $$$s$$$: $$$sss \\ldots$$$ Suppose that Alice and Bob play rounds according to this infinite string, left to right. If a character of the string $$$sss \\ldots$$$ is '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>', then Alice wins the round; if it's '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>', Bob wins the round. As soon as one of the players wins two rounds, the set ends in their favor, and a new set starts from the next round.</p><p>Let's define $$$a_i$$$ as the number of sets won by Alice among the first $$$i$$$ sets while playing according to the given scenario. Let's also define $$$r$$$ as the limit of ratio $$$\\frac{a_i}{i}$$$ as $$$i \\rightarrow \\infty$$$. If $$$r &gt; \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">winning for Alice</span>. If $$$r = \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">tied</span>. If $$$r &lt; \\frac{1}{2}$$$, we'll say that scenario $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">winning for Bob</span>.</p><p>You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>', and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>'. Consider all possible ways of replacing every '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>' with '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' or '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>' to obtain a string consisting only of characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>'. Count how many of them result in a scenario winning for Alice, how many result in a tied scenario, and how many result in a scenario winning for Bob. Print these three numbers modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",
