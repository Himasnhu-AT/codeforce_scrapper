    "statement": "<p>Owl Sonya decided to become a partymaker. To train for this role she gather all her owl friends in the country house. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> chairs located in a circle and consequently numbered with integers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>. Thus, chairs <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i>\u2009+\u20091</span> are neighbouring for all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>. Chairs <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> are also neighbouring. Some chairs are occupied by her friends. There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> friends in total. No two friends occupy the same chair. Rules are the following:</p><ol> <li> Each participant removes from the game the chair he is currently sitting on. </li><li> Each of the participants choose a direction that she will follow: clockwise (indices increase, from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> goes to <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>) and counter-clockwise (indices decrease, from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> goes to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>). This direction may coincide or be different for any pair of owls. </li><li> Each turn all guests move one step in the chosen directions. If some guest move to the position with a chair there, he removes this chair from the game. </li><li> Game ends if there are no more chairs left in the game. </li></ol><p>Owls are very busy and want to get rid of the game as soon as possible. They cooperate to pick the direction. Your goal is to find the minimum number o moves required to finish the game.</p>",
