    "statement": "<p>A Christmas party in city S. had <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> children. All children came in mittens. The mittens can be of different colors, but each child had the left and the right mitten of the same color. Let's say that the colors of the mittens are numbered with integers from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>, and the children are numbered from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Then the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th child has both mittens of color <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>.</p><p>The Party had Santa Claus ('Father Frost' in Russian), his granddaughter Snow Girl, the children danced around the richly decorated Christmas tree. In fact, everything was so bright and diverse that the children wanted to wear mittens of distinct colors. The children decided to swap the mittens so that each of them got one left and one right mitten in the end, and these two mittens were of distinct colors. All mittens are of the same size and fit all the children.</p><p>The children started exchanging the mittens haphazardly, but they couldn't reach the situation when each child has a pair of mittens of distinct colors. Vasily Petrov, the dad of one of the children, noted that in the general case the children's idea may turn out impossible. Besides, he is a mathematician and he came up with such scheme of distributing mittens that the number of children that have distinct-colored mittens was maximum. You task is to repeat his discovery. Note that the left and right mittens are different: each child must end up with one left and one right mitten.</p>",
