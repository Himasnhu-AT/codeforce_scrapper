There is an ancient tradition in Buryatia\u00a0\u2014 before the coronation, the ruler must show their strength to the inhabitants. To determine the strength of the $$$n$$$-th ruler, the inhabitants of the country give them an array of $$$a$$$ of exactly $$$n$$$ numbers, after which the ruler must turn all the elements of the array into zeros in the shortest time. The ruler can do the following two-step operation any number of times: </p><ul> <li> select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, so that $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$ and a non-negative integer $$$x$$$, then </li><li> for all $$$l \\leq i \\leq r$$$ assign $$$a_i := a_i \\oplus x$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR\">bitwise XOR operation</a>. It takes $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{r-l+1}{2} \\right\\rceil$$$ seconds to do this operation, where $$$\\lceil y \\rceil$$$ denotes $$$y$$$ rounded up to the nearest integer. </li></ul><p>Help Burenka calculate how much time she will need.</p>",
