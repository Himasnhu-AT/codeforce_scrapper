You, for some reason, want to figure out the permutation. To do that, you can give her an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 2$$$), two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$, $$$i \\neq j$$$), and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x \\le n - 1$$$). </p><p>Depending on $$$t$$$, she will answer: </p><ul> <li> $$$t = 1$$$: $$$\\max{(\\min{(x, p_i)}, \\min{(x + 1, p_j)})}$$$; </li><li> $$$t = 2$$$: $$$\\min{(\\max{(x, p_i)}, \\max{(x + 1, p_j)})}$$$. </li></ul><p>You can ask Nastia <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most</span> $$$\\lfloor \\frac {3 \\cdot n} { 2} \\rfloor + 30$$$ times.
