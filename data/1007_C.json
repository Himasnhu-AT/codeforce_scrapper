Vasya thought of two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and Vitya tries to guess them. Each round he tells Vasya two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If both $$$x=a$$$ and $$$y=b$$$ then Vitya wins. Else Vasya must say one of the three phrases: </p><ol> <li> $$$x$$$ is less than $$$a$$$; </li><li> $$$y$$$ is less than $$$b$$$; </li><li> $$$x$$$ is greater than $$$a$$$ or $$$y$$$ is greater than $$$b$$$. </li></ol><p>Vasya can't lie, but if multiple phrases are true, he may choose any of them. For example, if Vasya thought of numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, then he answers with the phrase $$$3$$$ to a query $$$(3, 4)$$$, and he can answer with the phrase $$$1$$$ or phrase $$$3$$$ to a query $$$(1, 5)$$$.</p><p>Help Vitya win in no more than $$$600$$$ rounds. </p>",
