Help him with that.</p><p>The <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>xor</i></span> operation is the bitwise exclusive \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">OR</span>\", that is denoted as \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">xor</span>\" in Pascal and \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">^</span>\" in C/C++/Java.</p>",
