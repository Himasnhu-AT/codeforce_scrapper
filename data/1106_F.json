Bob knows that for $$$i &gt; k$$$, $$$f_i$$$ can be obtained by the following recursive equation:</p><p>$$$$$$f_i = \\left(f_{i - 1} ^ {b_1} \\cdot f_{i - 2} ^ {b_2} \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot f_{i - k} ^ {b_k}\\right) \\bmod p,$$$$$$</p><p>which in short is</p><p>$$$$$$f_i = \\left(\\prod_{j = 1}^{k} f_{i - j}^{b_j}\\right) \\bmod p,$$$$$$</p><p>where $$$p = 998\\,244\\,353$$$ (a widely-used prime), $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$ are known integer constants, and $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$x$$$ divided by $$$y$$$.</p><p>Bob lost the values of $$$f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_k$$$, which is extremely troublesome \u2013 these are the basis of the sequence! Luckily, Bob remembers the first $$$k - 1$$$ elements of the sequence: $$$f_1 = f_2 = \\ldots = f_{k - 1} = 1$$$ and the $$$n$$$-th element: $$$f_n = m$$$. Please find any possible value of $$$f_k$$$. If no solution exists, just tell Bob that it is impossible to recover his favorite sequence, regardless of Bob's sadness.</p>",
