    "statement": "<p>Yaroslav, Andrey and Roman love playing cubes. Sometimes they get together and play cubes for hours and hours! </p><p>Today they got together again and they are playing cubes. Yaroslav took unit cubes and composed them into an <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>a</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>a</i></span> cube, Andrey made a <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>b</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>b</i></span> cube and Roman made a <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>c</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>c</i></span> cube. After that the game was finished and the guys left. But later, Vitaly entered the room. He saw the cubes and wanted to make a cube as well. But what size should the cube be? Of course it should be a large cube with the side of length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i>\u2009+\u2009<i>b</i>\u2009+\u2009<i>c</i></span>. Besides, Vitaly decided to decompose the cubes built by Yaroslav, Andrey and Roman and compose his own large cube out of them. However, it turned out that the unit cubes he got from destroying the three cubes just weren't enough to make a large cube. We know that Vitaly was short of exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cubes. Vitaly got upset, demolished everything and left. As he was leaving, he met Petya and told him that there had been three cubes in the room and that he needed another <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> unit cubes to make his own large cube.</p><p>Petya entered the room and saw the messily scattered cubes. He wanted to make it neat and orderly again. But he only knows that there had been three cubes, made of small unit cubes and that Vitaly needed <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> more unit cubes to make a large one! Help Petya understand, how many ways of sizes <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span>, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>c</i></span> are there to restore Yaroslav's, Andrey's and Roman's cubes.</p>",
