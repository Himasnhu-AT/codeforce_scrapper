When you fold, the part of the paper to the left of the line is symmetrically reflected on the right side.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3bbf5c1147cadc4d796501478d3f78fc732c5151.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries for values $$$f_1,\\ldots,f_q$$$.</p>",
