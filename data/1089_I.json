We call a sub-segment $$$p_l, p_{l+1}, \\dots, p_{r-1}, p_{r}$$$ of the permutation an <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">interval</span> if it is a reordering of some set of consecutive integers. For example, the permutation $$$(6,7,1,8,5,3,2,4)$$$ has the intervals $$$(6,7)$$$, $$$(5,3,2,4)$$$, $$$(3,2)$$$, and others. </p><p>Each permutation has some trivial intervals\u00a0\u2014 the full permutation itself and every single element. We call a permutation <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">interval-free</span> if it does not have non-trivial intervals. In other words, interval-free permutation does not have intervals of length between 2 and $$$n - 1$$$ inclusive. </p><p>Your task is to count the number of interval-free permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo prime number $$$p$$$. </p>",
