In the name of this great goal, they rallied around the powerful elf Timothy and began to plan the overthrow of the ruler of the Lonely Mountain.</p><p>The army of Middle-earth inhabitants will consist of several squads. It is known that each pair of creatures of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the same race</span>, which are in different squads, adds $$$b$$$ units to the total strength of the army. But since it will be difficult for Timothy to lead an army consisting of a large number of squads, the total strength of an army consisting of $$$k$$$ squads is reduced by $$$(k - 1) \\cdot x$$$ units. Note that the army always consists <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">of at least one squad</span>.</p><p>It is known that there are $$$n$$$ races in Middle-earth, and the number of creatures of the $$$i$$$-th race is equal to $$$c_i$$$.
