    "statement": "<p>There are $$$n$$$ kids, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, dancing in a circle around the Christmas tree. Let's enumerate them in a clockwise direction as $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ (all these numbers are from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and are distinct, so $$$p$$$ is a permutation). Let the next kid for a kid $$$p_i$$$ be kid $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ if $$$i &lt; n$$$ and $$$p_1$$$ otherwise. After the dance, each kid remembered two kids: the next kid (let's call him $$$x$$$) and the next kid for $$$x$$$. Each kid told you which kids he/she remembered: the kid $$$i$$$ remembered kids $$$a_{i, 1}$$$ and $$$a_{i, 2}$$$. However, the order of $$$a_{i, 1}$$$ and $$$a_{i, 2}$$$ can differ from their order in the circle.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/4b7194b47baa591e9db3cb6908976996d197073d.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Example: 5 kids in a circle, $$$p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]$$$ (or any cyclic shift). The information kids remembered is: $$$a_{1,1}=3$$$, $$$a_{1,2}=5$$$; $$$a_{2,1}=1$$$, $$$a_{2,2}=4$$$; $$$a_{3,1}=2$$$, $$$a_{3,2}=4$$$; $$$a_{4,1}=1$$$, $$$a_{4,2}=5$$$; $$$a_{5,1}=2$$$, $$$a_{5,2}=3$$$.</span> </center><p>You have to restore the order of the kids in the circle using this information.
