In other words he can learn a chapter of a particular subject in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> hours.</p><p>Well Devu is not complete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a subject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will require exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to understand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not be less than 1 hour.</p><p>You can teach him the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> subjects in any possible order. Find out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all the subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than teaching a dumb guy.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Please be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit data type.</span></p>",

    "note": "<p>Look at the first example. Consider the order of subjects: <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will take him <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> hours per chapter, so it will take <span class=\"tex-span\">12</span> hours to teach first subject. After teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> hours. Now teaching him second subject will take <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20092</span> hours. Hence you will need to spend <span class=\"tex-span\">12\u2009+\u20092\u2009=\u200914</span> hours.</p><p>Consider the order of subjects: <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. When you teach Devu the second subject, then it will take him <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> hours per chapter, so it will take <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009=\u20093</span> hours to teach the second subject.

When you teach Devu the second subject, it will take him <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the third subject, it will take him <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> hours per chapter. In total it takes <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> hours.</p>",
