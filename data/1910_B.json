    "statement": "<p>Monocarp is a security guard in Berland State University. Every day, he tracks how many people and at what time enter and leave the university. He writes this information down as follows: </p><ul> <li> when someone enters the university, Monocarp writes a plus sign '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>'; </li><li> when someone leaves the university, Monocarp writes a minus sign '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-</span>'. </li></ul><p>At the beginning of the current day, there are no people at the university, except for Monocarp. During the day, Monocarp wrote out a sequence $$$s$$$. The characters in $$$s$$$ are listed in the order Monocarp wrote them.</p><p>Suddenly, Monocarp's boss decided to check his work. Unfortunately, Monocarp is a bit careless. So, the sequence $$$s$$$ that he wrote might be impossible. For example, the sequence \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+-</span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-</span>\" can't happen, since it represents a scenario when one person enters the university and two leave.</p><p>Before his boss starts checking the sequence, Monocarp has the time to swap at most one pair of characters in it. Can he do it in such a way that the resulting sequence is plausible? Note that if the given sequence is already plausible, Monocarp doesn't have to swap anything.</p>",

A plus sign '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span>' represents a person entering the university.
