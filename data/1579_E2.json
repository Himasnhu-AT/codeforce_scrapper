    "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.</span></p><p>You are given an integer array $$$a[1 \\ldots n] = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$.</p><p>Let us consider an empty <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux\">deque</a> (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements $$$[3, 4, 4]$$$ currently in the deque, adding an element $$$1$$$ to the beginning will produce the sequence $$$[\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4]$$$, and adding the same element to the end will produce $$$[3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}]$$$.</p><p>The elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with $$$a_1$$$ and finishing with $$$a_n$$$. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.</p><p>For example, if we consider an array $$$a = [3, 7, 5, 5]$$$, one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: <table class=\"tex-tabular\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 1.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$3$$$ to the beginning of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{3}]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 2.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$7$$$ to the end of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[3, \\color{red}{7}]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 3.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$5$$$ to the end of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[3, 7, \\color{red}{5}]$$$ in it;</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">$$$\\quad$$$ 4.</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">add $$$5$$$ to the beginning of the deque:</td><td class=\"tex-tabular-text-align-left\">deque has a sequence $$$[\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5]$$$ in it;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. </p><p>An <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">inversion</span> in sequence $$$d$$$ is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i &lt; j$$$ and $$$d_i &gt; d_j$$$. For example, the array $$$d = [5, 3, 7, 5]$$$ has exactly two inversions\u00a0\u2014 $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$, since $$$d_1 = 5 &gt; 3 = d_2$$$ and $$$d_3 = 7 &gt; 5 = d_4$$$.</p>",

The second line of the description contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the array.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p>",
