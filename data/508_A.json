In one move, Pasha can choose any pixel and color it black. In particular, he can choose the pixel that is already black, then after the boy's move the pixel does not change, that is, it remains black. Pasha loses the game when a <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u00d7\u20092</span> square consisting of black pixels is formed. </p><p>Pasha has made a plan of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> moves, according to which he will paint pixels.
