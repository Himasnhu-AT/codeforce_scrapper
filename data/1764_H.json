Initially, $$$a_i=i$$$.</p><p>Doremy has $$$m$$$ segments $$$[l_i,r_i]$$$ ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n$$$). Each segment describes an operation. Operation $$$i$$$ is performed as follows: </p><ul> <li> For each $$$j$$$ such that $$$l_i &lt; j \\leq r_i$$$, set $$$a_j := a_{l_i}$$$. </li></ul><p>Doremy also selects an integer $$$k$$$. She wants to know for each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m-1$$$, the number of distinct colors in the array after performing operations $$$x \\bmod m +1, (x+1) \\bmod m + 1, \\ldots, (x+k-1) \\bmod m +1$$$.
