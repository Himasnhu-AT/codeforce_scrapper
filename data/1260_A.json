Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.</p><p>Your house has $$$n$$$ rooms. In the $$$i$$$-th room you can install at most $$$c_i$$$ heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with $$$k$$$ sections is equal to $$$k^2$$$ burles.</p><p>Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least $$$sum_i$$$ sections in total in the $$$i$$$-th room. </p><p>For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most $$$c_i$$$ radiators with total number of sections not less than $$$sum_i$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 1000$$$) \u2014 the number of rooms.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains the description of some room. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$c_i$$$ and $$$sum_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_i, sum_i \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the $$$i$$$-th room, respectively.</p>",

The optimal variant is $$$[3, 3]$$$ and it costs $$$3^2+ 3^2 = 18$$$.</p>",
