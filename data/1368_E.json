    "statement": "<p>Arthur owns a ski resort on a mountain. There are $$$n$$$ landing spots on the mountain numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from the top to the foot of the mountain. The spots are connected with one-directional ski tracks. All tracks go towards the foot of the mountain, so there are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">no directed cycles</span> formed by the tracks. There are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most two tracks leaving each spot</span>, but many tracks may enter the same spot.</p><p>A skier can start skiing from one spot and stop in another spot if there is a sequence of tracks that lead from the starting spot and end in the ending spot. Unfortunately, recently there were many accidents, because the structure of the resort allows a skier to go through dangerous paths, by reaching high speed and endangering himself and the other customers. Here, a path is called dangerous, if it consists of at least two tracks.</p><p>Arthur wants to secure his customers by closing some of the spots in a way that there are no dangerous paths in the resort. When a spot is closed, all tracks entering and leaving that spot become unusable. </p><p>Formally, after closing some of the spots, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">there should not be a path that consists of two or more tracks</span>.</p><p>Arthur doesn't want to close too many spots. He will be happy to find any way to close <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most $$$\\frac{4}{7}n$$$ spots</span> so that the remaining part is safe. Help him find any suitable way to do so.</p>",

Each of these lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x &lt; y \\leq n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 indices of the starting and finishing spots for the respective track. It is guaranteed that at most two tracks start at each spot.
