    "statement": "<p>In Disgaea as in most role-playing games, characters have skills that determine the character's ability to use certain weapons or spells. If the character does not have the necessary skill, he cannot use it. The skill level is represented as an integer that increases when you use this skill. Different character classes are characterized by different skills. </p><p>Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character's class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. </p><p>Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. </p><p>As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> coefficient (if the skill level was equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>, then after transmigration it becomes equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">[<i>kx</i>]</span>, where <span class=\"tex-span\">[<i>y</i>]</span> is the integral part of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i></span>). If some skill's levels are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly less</span> than <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span>, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>. </p><p>Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible. </p><p>You are suggested to solve the following problem: what skills will the character have after transmigration and what will the levels of those skills be?</p>",
