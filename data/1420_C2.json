You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok\u00e9mon living in the wild pikachu herd.</p><p>But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok\u00e9mon! Pok\u00e9mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok\u00e9mon army to resist.</p><p>First, Andrew counted all the pok\u00e9mon\u00a0\u2014 there were exactly $$$n$$$ pikachu. The strength of the $$$i$$$-th pok\u00e9mon is equal to $$$a_i$$$, and all these numbers are distinct.</p><p>As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $$$b$$$ from $$$k$$$ indices such that $$$1 \\le b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; b_k \\le n$$$, and his army will consist of pok\u00e9mons with forces $$$a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$$$.</p><p>The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $$$a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$$$.</p><p>Andrew is experimenting with pok\u00e9mon order. He performs $$$q$$$ operations. In $$$i$$$-th operation Andrew swaps $$$l_i$$$-th and $$$r_i$$$-th pok\u00e9mon.</p><p>Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok\u00e9mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.</p><p>Help Andrew and the pok\u00e9mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!</p>",
