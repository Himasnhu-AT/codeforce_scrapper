    "statement": "<p>Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.</p><p>He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer $$$n$$$. Initially the value of $$$n$$$ equals to $$$v$$$ and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $$$x$$$ that $$$x&lt;n$$$ and $$$x$$$ is not a divisor of $$$n$$$, then subtract $$$x$$$ from $$$n$$$. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of $$$n$$$ in the end.</p><p>Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example, the player can choose $$$x=3$$$ in the first turn, then $$$n$$$ becomes $$$5$$$. He can then choose $$$x=4$$$ in the second turn to get $$$n=1$$$ as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However, for example, he cannot choose $$$x=2$$$ in the first turn because $$$2$$$ is a divisor of $$$8$$$.</p><p>In the second example, since $$$n=1$$$ initially, the player can do nothing.</p>",
