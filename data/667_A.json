    "statement": "<p>A lot of people in Berland hates rain, but you do not. Rain pacifies, puts your thoughts in order. By these years you have developed a good tradition \u2014 when it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. </p><p>Today everything had changed quietly. You went on the street with a cup contained water, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. </p><p>Thus, your cup is a cylinder with diameter equals <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> centimeters. Initial level of water in cup equals <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>h</i></span> centimeters from the bottom. </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/d6f306bd87bae2412cdd49fa218e24faf2dc13c7.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>You drink a water with a speed equals <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if you do not drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>e</i></span> centimeters per second. The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly and continuously. </p><p>Find the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after <span class=\"tex-span\">10<sup class=\"upper-index\">4</sup></span> seconds.</p><p>Note one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.</p>",
