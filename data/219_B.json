    "statement": "<p>Polycarpus is an amateur businessman. Recently he was surprised to find out that the market for paper scissors is completely free! Without further ado, Polycarpus decided to start producing and selling such scissors.</p><p>Polycaprus calculated that the optimal celling price for such scissors would be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>p</i></span> bourles. However, he read somewhere that customers are attracted by prices that say something like \"Special Offer! Super price 999 bourles!\". So Polycarpus decided to lower the price a little if it leads to the desired effect.</p><p>Polycarpus agrees to lower the price by no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> bourles so that the number of nines at the end of the resulting price is maximum. If there are several ways to do it, he chooses the maximum possible price.</p><p>Note, Polycarpus counts only the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">trailing</span> nines in a price.</p>",
