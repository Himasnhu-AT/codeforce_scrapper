For the $$$i$$$-th distance learning course, a student can receive a grade ranging from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$.</p><p>However, not all courses may be available to each student. Specifically, the $$$j$$$-th student is only given courses with numbers from $$$l_j$$$ to $$$r_j$$$, meaning the distance learning courses with numbers $$$l_j, l_j + 1, \\ldots, r_j$$$.</p><p>The creators of the distance learning courses have decided to determine the final grade in a special way. Let the $$$j$$$-th student receive grades $$$c_{l_j}, c_{l_j + 1}, \\ldots, c_{r_j}$$$ for their distance learning courses. Then their final grade will be equal to $$$c_{l_j}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{l_j + 1}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$\\ldots$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{r_j}$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR\">bitwise OR</a> operation.</p><p>Since the chatbot for solving distance learning courses is broken, the students have asked for your help.
