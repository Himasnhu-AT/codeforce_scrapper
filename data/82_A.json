    "statement": "<p>Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh and Howard are in the queue for a \"Double Cola\" drink vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. The first one in the queue (Sheldon) buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two Sheldons go to the end of the queue. Then the next in the queue (Leonard) buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two Leonards, and so on. This process continues ad infinitum.</p><p>For example, Penny drinks the third can of cola and the queue will look like this: Rajesh, Howard, Sheldon, Sheldon, Leonard, Leonard, Penny, Penny.</p><p>Write a program that will print the name of a man who will drink the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>-th can.</p><p>Note that in the very beginning the queue looks like that: Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh, Howard. The first person is Sheldon.</p>",
