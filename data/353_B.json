He arbitrarily chooses <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> cubes and puts them in the first heap. The remaining cubes form the second heap. </p><p>Valera decided to play with cubes. During the game he takes a cube from the first heap and writes down the number it has. Then he takes a cube from the second heap and write out its two digits near two digits he had written (to the right of them). In the end he obtained a single fourdigit integer \u2014 the first two digits of it is written on the cube from the first heap, and the second two digits of it is written on the second cube from the second heap.</p><p>Valera knows arithmetic very well. So, he can easily count the number of distinct fourdigit numbers he can get in the game. The other question is: how to split cubes into two heaps so that this number (the number of distinct fourdigit integers Valera can get) will be as large as possible?</p>",
