    "statement": "<p>You are given two integers $$$b$$$ and $$$w$$$. You have a chessboard of size $$$10^9 \\times 10^9$$$ with the top left cell at $$$(1; 1)$$$, the cell $$$(1; 1)$$$ is painted <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">white</span>.</p><p>Your task is to find a connected component on this chessboard that contains exactly $$$b$$$ black cells and exactly $$$w$$$ white cells. Two cells are called connected if they share a side (i.e. for the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ there are at most four connected cells: $$$(x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1), (x, y + 1)$$$). A set of cells is called a connected component if for every pair of cells $$$C_1$$$ and $$$C_2$$$ from this set, there exists a sequence of cells $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, ..., $$$c_k$$$ such that $$$c_1 = C_1$$$, $$$c_k = C_2$$$, all $$$c_i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ are belong to this set of cells and for every $$$i \\in [1, k - 1]$$$, cells $$$c_i$$$ and $$$c_{i + 1}$$$ are connected.</p><p>Obviously, it can be impossible to find such component. In this case print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\". Otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> suitable connected component.</p><p>You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ queries follow.</p><p>The only line of the query contains two integers $$$b$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \\le b, w \\le 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of black cells required and the number of white cells required.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of numbers of cells does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\\sum w + \\sum b \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each query, print the answer to it.</p><p>If it is impossible to find the required component, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span>\" on the first line.</p><p>Otherwise, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span>\" on the first line. In the next $$$b + w$$$ lines print coordinates of cells of your component in any order. There should be exactly $$$b$$$ black cells and $$$w$$$ white cells in your answer. The printed component should be connected.</p><p>If there are several answers, you can print <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span>. All coordinates in the answer should be in the range $$$[1; 10^9]$$$.</p>",
