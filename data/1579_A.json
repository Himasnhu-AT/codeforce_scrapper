    "statement": "<p>Casimir has a string $$$s$$$ which consists of capital Latin letters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>', and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:</p><ul> <li> he can either erase exactly one letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>' <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">and</span> exactly one letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent); </li><li> or he can erase exactly one letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>' <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">and</span> exactly one letter '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). </li></ul><p>Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by $$$2$$$. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.</p><p>For example, with $$$s$$$\u00a0$$$=$$$\u00a0\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ABCABC</span>\" he can obtain a string $$$s$$$\u00a0$$$=$$$\u00a0\"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ACBC</span>\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>' and the second occurrence of '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.</p><p>For a given string $$$s$$$ determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?</p>",

The string $$$s$$$ consists of capital letters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>' and has a length from $$$1$$$ to $$$50$$$ letters, inclusive.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$t$$$ lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">NO</span> otherwise.</p><p>You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yEs</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">yes</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Yes</span>, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">YES</span> will all be recognized as positive answers).</p>",
