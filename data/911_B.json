    "statement": "<p>It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> pieces, and the second one \u2014 into <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> pieces.</p><p>Ivan knows that there will be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:</p><ol> <li> Each piece of each cake is put on some plate; </li><li> Each plate contains at least one piece of cake; </li><li> No plate contains pieces of both cakes. </li></ol><p>To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> pieces of cake.</p><p>Help Ivan to calculate this number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>!</p>",
