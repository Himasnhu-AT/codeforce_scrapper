    "statement": "<p>One day, $$$n$$$ people ($$$n$$$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.</p><p>Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $$$1$$$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 2, 1, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 3, 4]$$$ are indistinguishable.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=2$$$ then the number of ways is $$$1$$$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=4$$$ then the number of ways is $$$3$$$. Possible options:</p><ul> <li> one round dance \u2014 $$$[1,2]$$$, another \u2014 $$$[3,4]$$$; </li><li> one round dance \u2014 $$$[2,4]$$$, another \u2014 $$$[3,1]$$$; </li><li> one round dance \u2014 $$$[4,1]$$$, another \u2014 $$$[3,2]$$$. </li></ul><p>Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ people.</p>",
