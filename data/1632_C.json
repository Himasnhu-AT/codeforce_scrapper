Tomorrow he will have to write an informatics test by the strictest teacher in the school, Pavel Denisovich. </p><p>Igor knows how the test will be conducted: first of all, the teacher will give each student two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a &lt; b$$$). After that, the student can apply any of the following operations any number of times: </p><ul> <li> $$$a := a + 1$$$ (increase $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$), </li><li> $$$b := b + 1$$$ (increase $$$b$$$ by $$$1$$$), </li><li> $$$a := a \\ | \\ b$$$ (replace $$$a$$$ with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR\">bitwise OR</a> of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$). </li></ul><p>To get full marks on the test, the student has to tell the teacher the minimum required number of operations to make $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal.</p><p>Igor already knows which numbers the teacher will give him. Help him figure out what is the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.</p>",
