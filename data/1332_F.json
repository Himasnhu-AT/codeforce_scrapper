Today, Eric teaches independent set and edge-induced subgraph.</p><p>Given a graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$, an <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">independent set</span> is a subset of vertices $$$V' \\subset V$$$ such that for every pair $$$u,v \\in V'$$$, $$$(u,v) \\not \\in E$$$ (i.e. no edge in $$$E$$$ connects two vertices from $$$V'$$$).</p><p>An <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">edge-induced subgraph</span> consists of a subset of edges $$$E' \\subset E$$$ and all the vertices in the original graph that are incident on at least one edge in the subgraph.</p><p>Given $$$E' \\subset E$$$, denote $$$G[E']$$$ the edge-induced subgraph such that $$$E'$$$ is the edge set of the subgraph. Here is an illustration of those definitions:</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1919834c663d1908a2c59bdf583b2e7acc0be1b6.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>In order to help his students get familiar with those definitions, he leaves the following problem as an exercise:</p><p>Given a tree $$$G=(V,E)$$$, calculate the sum of $$$w(H)$$$ over all except null edge-induced subgraph $$$H$$$ of $$$G$$$, where $$$w(H)$$$ is the number of independent sets in $$$H$$$. Formally, calculate $$$\\sum \\limits_{\\emptyset \\not= E' \\subset E} w(G[E'])$$$.</p><p>Show Eric that you are smarter than his students by providing the correct answer as quickly as possible.
