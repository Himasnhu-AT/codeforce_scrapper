You should divide it into a minimal number of continuous segments, such that in each segment there are no two numbers (on different positions), whose product is a perfect square.</p><p>Moreover, it is allowed to do at most $$$k$$$ such operations before the division: choose a number in the array and change its value to any positive integer.
