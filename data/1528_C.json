After endless decades of fighting, they finally became allies to prepare a Codeforces round. To celebrate this fortunate event, they decided to make a memorial graph on $$$n$$$ vertices.</p><p>They add an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the memorial graph if <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">both</span> of the following conditions hold: </p><ul> <li> One of $$$u$$$ or $$$v$$$ is the ancestor of the other in Soroush's tree. </li><li> Neither of $$$u$$$ or $$$v$$$ is the ancestor of the other in Keshi's tree. </li></ul><p>Here vertex $$$u$$$ is considered ancestor of vertex $$$v$$$, if $$$u$$$ lies on the path from $$$1$$$ (the root) to the $$$v$$$.</p><p>Popping out of nowhere, Mashtali tried to find the maximum clique in the memorial graph for no reason. He failed because the graph was too big. </p><p>Help Mashtali by finding the size of the maximum clique in the memorial graph.</p><p>As a reminder, clique is a subset of vertices of the graph, each two of which are connected by an edge.</p>",
