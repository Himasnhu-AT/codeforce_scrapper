You need to process queries of the following types:</p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">+</span> $$$x$$$\u00a0\u2014 add the integer $$$x$$$ to the end of the array $$$a$$$. </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-</span> $$$k$$$\u00a0\u2014 remove the last $$$k$$$ numbers from the array $$$a$$$. </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">!</span>\u00a0\u2014 roll back the last active change (i.e., make the array $$$a$$$ the way it was before the change).
