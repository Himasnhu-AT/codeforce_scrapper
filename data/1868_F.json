Now he gets a really interesting problem from his friend Daniel. However, it seems too hard for him to solve it, so he asks you for help.</p><p>Given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.</p><p>In one operation, you do the following: </p><ul> <li> Select an interval $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1\\le l\\le r\\le n$$$), such that the sum of the interval is the largest among <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all intervals</span> in the array $$$a$$$. More formally, $$$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=l}^r a_i=\\max_{1\\le l'\\le r'\\le n}\\sum_{i=l'}^{r'} a_i$$$.</li><li> Then subtract $$$1$$$ from all elements $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\\ldots,a_r$$$. </li></ul><p>Find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make $$$a_i&lt;0$$$ for every $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^6\\le a_i\\le 10^6$$$) \u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.</p>",
