Their mom doesn't think so. She says that they have to read some amount of books before all entertainments. Alice and Bob will read each book <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">together</span> to end this exercise faster.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ books in the family library. The $$$i$$$-th book is described by three integers: $$$t_i$$$ \u2014 the amount of time Alice and Bob need to spend to read it, $$$a_i$$$ (equals $$$1$$$ if Alice likes the $$$i$$$-th book and $$$0$$$ if not), and $$$b_i$$$ (equals $$$1$$$ if Bob likes the $$$i$$$-th book and $$$0$$$ if not).</p><p>So they need to choose some books from the given $$$n$$$ books in such a way that:</p><ul> <li> Alice likes <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least</span> $$$k$$$ books from the chosen set and Bob likes <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least</span> $$$k$$$ books from the chosen set; </li><li> the total reading time of these books is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimized</span> (they are children and want to play and joy as soon a possible). </li></ul><p>The set they choose is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the same</span> for both Alice an Bob (it's shared between them) and they read all books <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">together</span>, so the total reading time is the sum of $$$t_i$$$ over all books that are in the chosen set.</p><p>Your task is to help them and find any suitable set of books or determine that it is impossible to find such a set.</p>",
