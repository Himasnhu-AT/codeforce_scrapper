    "statement": "<p>The Beroil corporation structure is hierarchical, that is it can be represented as a tree. Let's examine the presentation of this structure as follows:</p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>employee</i></span> ::= <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>name</i></span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span> | <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>name</i></span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">:</span><span class=\"tex-span\"><i>employee</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub></span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">,</span><span class=\"tex-span\"><i>employee</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub></span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">,</span> ... <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">,</span><span class=\"tex-span\"><i>employee</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>k</i></sub></span><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span> </li><li> <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>name</i></span> ::= name of an employee </li></ul><p>That is, the description of each employee consists of his name, a colon (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">:</span>), the descriptions of all his subordinates separated by commas, and, finally, a dot. If an employee has no subordinates, then the colon is not present in his description.</p><p>For example, line <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">MIKE:MAX.,ARTEM:MIKE..,DMITRY:DMITRY.,DMITRY...</span> is the correct way of recording the structure of a corporation where the director <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">MIKE</span> has subordinates <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">MAX</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ARTEM</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DMITRY</span>. <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ARTEM</span> has a subordinate whose name is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">MIKE</span>, just as the name of his boss and two subordinates of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DMITRY</span> are called <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DMITRY</span>, just like himself.</p><p>In the Beroil corporation every employee can only correspond with his subordinates, at that the subordinates are not necessarily direct. Let's call an uncomfortable situation the situation when a person whose name is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> writes a letter to another person whose name is also <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. In the example given above are two such pairs: a pair involving <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">MIKE</span>, and two pairs for <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DMITRY</span> (a pair for each of his subordinates).</p><p>Your task is by the given structure of the corporation to find the number of uncomfortable pairs in it.</p><center><img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/11018622b70b7e278e6c9c9b7569a62fe1de9e39.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/></center>",
