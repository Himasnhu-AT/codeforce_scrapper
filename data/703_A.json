    "statement": "<p>Mishka is a little polar bear. As known, little bears loves spending their free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning, walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started playing the game.</p><p>Rules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> is defined. In every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.</p><p>In average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.</p><p>Mishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!</p>",
