String $$$s$$$ becomes equal to \"aabc\". Then the second letter 'a' again. String $$$s$$$ becomes equal to \"aabcbc\". And so on, generating infinitely many different strings.</p><p>In the third example, you can either leave string $$$s$$$ as is, performing zero moves, or replace the only 'a' with \"b\".
