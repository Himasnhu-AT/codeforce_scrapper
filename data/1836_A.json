    "statement": "<p>John is a lead programmer on a destroyer belonging to the space navy of the Confederacy of Independent Operating Systems. One of his tasks is checking if the electronic brains of robots were damaged during battles.</p><p>A standard test is to order the robots to form one or several lines, in each line the robots should stand one after another. After that, each robot reports the number of robots standing in front of it <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">in its line</span>.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/1e75235cfc37a2a23f4880cb770ce2a4c546c27a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"151px\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">An example of robots' arrangement (the front of the lines is on the left). The robots report the numbers above.</span> </center><p>The $$$i$$$-th robot reported number $$$l_i$$$. Unfortunately, John does not know which line each robot stands in, and can't check the reported numbers. Please determine if it is possible to form the lines in such a way that all reported numbers are correct, or not.</p>",
