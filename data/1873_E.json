    "statement": "<p>You love fish, that's why you have decided to build an aquarium. You have a piece of coral made of $$$n$$$ columns, the $$$i$$$-th of which is $$$a_i$$$ units tall. Afterwards, you will build a tank around the coral as follows: </p><ul> <li> Pick an integer $$$h \\geq 1$$$\u00a0\u2014 the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">height</span> of the tank. Build walls of height $$$h$$$ on either side of the tank. </li><li> Then, fill the tank up with water so that the height of each column is $$$h$$$, unless the coral is taller than $$$h$$$; then no water should be added to this column. </li></ul> For example, with $$$a=[3,1,2,4,6,2,5]$$$ and a height of $$$h=4$$$, you will end up using a total of $$$w=8$$$ units of water, as shown. <center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5a69329b8d22a26c9f4de9eb96076db3e8c712ba.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center> You can use at most $$$x$$$ units of water to fill up the tank, but you want to build the biggest tank possible.

So $$$h=4$$$ is optimal.</p><p>In the second test case, we can pick $$$h=4$$$ and add $$$3$$$ units to each column, using a total of $$$9$$$ units of water. It can be shown that this is optimal.</p><p>In the third test case, we can pick $$$h=2$$$ and use all of our water, so it is optimal.</p>",
