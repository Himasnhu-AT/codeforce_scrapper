    "statement": "<p>You are playing the game \"Arranging The Sheep\". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.</span>' (empty space) and '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*</span>' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exists and is empty</span>. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=6$$$ and the level is described by the string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">**.*..</span>\", then the following game scenario is possible: </p><ul> <li> the sheep at the $$$4$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">**..*.</span>\"; </li><li> the sheep at the $$$2$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">*.*.*.</span>\"; </li><li> the sheep at the $$$1$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.**.*.</span>\"; </li><li> the sheep at the $$$3$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">.*.**.</span>\"; </li><li> the sheep at the $$$2$$$ position moves to the right, the state of the level: \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">..***.</span>\"; </li><li> the sheep are lined up and the game ends. </li></ul><p>For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.</p>",
