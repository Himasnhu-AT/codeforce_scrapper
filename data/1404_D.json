The judge chooses the pairs $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(3, 4)$$$, and you reply with the numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. This is a valid choice since it contains exactly one number from each pair, and the sum $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$.</p><p>In the second sample, $$$n = 2$$$ again, and you play as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">First</span>. You choose the pairs $$$(2, 4)$$$ and $$$(1, 3)$$$. The judge fails to choose a number from each pair such that their sum is divisible by $$$4$$$, so the answer is correct.</p><p>Note that the sample tests are just for illustration of the interaction protocol, and don't necessarily correspond to the behavior of the real interactor.</p>",
