Remembering an old parable (but not its moral), Arkady wants to give to his friends one set of candies per each cell of the field: the set of candies for cell $$$(i, j)$$$ will have exactly $$$(i^2 + j^2)$$$ candies of unique type.</p><p>There are $$$m$$$ friends who deserve the present. How many of these $$$n \\times n$$$ sets of candies can be split equally into $$$m$$$ parts without cutting a candy into pieces? Note that each set has to be split independently since the types of candies in different sets are different.</p>",
