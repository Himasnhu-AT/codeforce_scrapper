    "statement": "<p>One day Sasha visited the farmer 2D and his famous magnetic farm. On this farm, the crop grows due to the influence of a special magnetic field. Maintaining of the magnetic field is provided by $$$n$$$ machines, and the power of the $$$i$$$-th machine is $$$a_i$$$. </p><p>This year 2D decided to cultivate a new culture, but what exactly he didn't say. For the successful growth of the new culture, it is necessary to slightly change the powers of the machines. 2D can <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most once</span> choose an arbitrary integer $$$x$$$, then choose one machine and reduce the power of its machine by $$$x$$$ times, and at the same time increase the power of one another machine by $$$x$$$ times (powers of all the machines must stay <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive integers</span>). Note that he may not do that if he wants. More formally, 2D can choose two such indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, and one integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x$$$ is a divisor of $$$a_i$$$, and change powers as following: $$$a_i = \\frac{a_i}{x}$$$, $$$a_j = a_j \\cdot x$$$</p><p>Sasha is very curious, that's why he wants to calculate the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> total power the farmer can reach. There are too many machines, and Sasha can't cope with computations, help him!</p>",

At the same time, the farmer can leave is be as it is and the total power won't change.</p><p>In the third example, it is optimal to leave it be as it is.</p>",
