Then, he makes two unsuccessful attempts for the second boss. Then, Polycarp makes two unsuccessful attempts. Then, Monocarp makes two more attempts and kills the boss on his fourth attempt. The third boss is similar. First, two unsuccessful attempts by Monocarp. Then, two unsuccessful attempts by Polycarp. Then, Monocarp has two more attempts, but even his first one is successful, since $$$a_3 = 3$$$. The fourth boss is also killed by Monocarp. Thus, $$$k = 2$$$ is the answer.</p>",
