There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> different boxes and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> different items, and each turn a player can either add a new box or a new item. The player, after whose turn the number of ways of putting <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> items into <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> boxes becomes no less then a certain given number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, loses.
