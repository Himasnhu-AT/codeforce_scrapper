Today some villains have set on fire first $$$n - 1$$$ of them, and now the only safety building is $$$n$$$-th skyscraper.</p><p>Let's call a jump from $$$i$$$-th skyscraper to $$$j$$$-th ($$$i &lt; j$$$) <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">discrete</span>, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if $$$i &lt; j$$$ and one of the following conditions satisfied: </p><ul> <li> $$$i + 1 = j$$$ </li><li> $$$\\max(h_{i + 1}, \\ldots, h_{j - 1}) &lt; \\min(h_i, h_j)$$$ </li><li> $$$\\max(h_i, h_j) &lt; \\min(h_{i + 1}, \\ldots, h_{j - 1})$$$. </li></ul><p>At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach $$$n$$$-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.</p>",
