You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.</span></p><p>Little R has counted many sets before, and now she decides to count arrays.</p><p>Little R thinks an array $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$ consisting of non-negative integers is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">continuous</span> if and only if, for each $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$\\lvert b_i - b_{i-1} \\rvert = 1$$$ is satisfied. She likes continuity, so she only wants to generate continuous arrays.</p><p>If Little R is given $$$b_0$$$ and $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$, she will try to generate a non-negative continuous array $$$b$$$, which has no similarity with $$$a$$$. More formally, for all $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$, $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$ holds.</p><p>However, Little R does not have any array $$$a$$$. Instead, she gives you $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$b_0$$$. She wants to count the different integer arrays $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$ satisfying:</p><ul> <li> $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq m$$$; </li><li> At least one non-negative continuous array $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$ can be generated. </li></ul><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note that $$$b_i \\geq 0$$$, but the $$$b_i$$$ can be arbitrarily large.</span></p><p>Since the actual answer may be enormous, please just tell her the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.</p>",

In total, there are $$$6$$$ valid choices of $$$a_1, \\ldots, a_n$$$: in fact, it can be proved that only $$$a = [2, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$a = [2, 1, 2]$$$ make it impossible to construct a non-negative continuous $$$b_0, \\ldots, b_n$$$, so the answer is $$$2^3 - 2 = 6$$$.</p>",
