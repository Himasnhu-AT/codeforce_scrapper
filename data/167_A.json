    "statement": "<p>In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.</p><p>A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>d</i></span> meters from the depot. We know for the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.</p><p>Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.</p><p>You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.</p>",
