You know that the bus fleet owns two types of buses: with two axles (these buses have $$$4$$$ wheels) and with three axles (these buses have $$$6$$$ wheels).</p><p>You don't know how many buses of which type the AvtoBus bus fleet owns, so you wonder how many buses the fleet might have. You have to determine the minimum and the maximum number of buses that can be in the fleet if you know that the total number of wheels for all buses is $$$n$$$.</p>",

The following options are possible:</p><ul> <li> Four buses with three axles. </li><li> Three buses with two axles and two buses with three axles. </li><li> Six buses with two axles. </li></ul><p>So the minimum number of buses is $$$4$$$ and the maximum number of buses is $$$6$$$.</p>",
