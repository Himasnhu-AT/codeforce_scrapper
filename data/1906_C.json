    "statement": "<p>You found an antique box in your warehouse and decided to open it. The moment you open the box, it traps you into a cursed game where you are playing against a demon. The game consists of $$$333$$$ rounds and you have to win all rounds in order to escape. The demon also gives you $$$999$$$ coins that you can use throughout all rounds.</p><p>Note that in this problem, denote cell $$$(r, c)$$$ of a grid as the cell in row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ of the grid.</p><p>Before the start of each round, the demon will prepare a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">secret paper</span>, which can be represented as a grid with $$$3$$$ rows and $$$3$$$ columns, both numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$. The demon will secretly put a hole in <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one or more cells</span>, and you are not aware which cells have a hole in it. Then, the round starts with the demon giving you an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">odd</span> integer $$$N$$$ ($$$3 \\leq N \\leq 33$$$).</p><p>Within each round, you can ask the demon several queries, each costing you one coin. For each query, you are allowed to give the demon <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">your paper</span>, which can be represented as a grid with $$$N$$$ rows and $$$N$$$ columns, both numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$. Each cell is coloured either black or white by you.</p><p>For each of your query, the demon will calculate a binary <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">result grid</span> with $$$N - 2$$$ rows and $$$N - 2$$$ columns, both numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N - 2$$$. The value on cell $$$(r, c)$$$ of the result grid is filled as follows.</p><ul> <li> The demon will put the secret paper on top of your paper such that the cell $$$(r + i - 1, c + j - 1)$$$ of your paper aligns with the cell $$$(i, j)$$$ of the secret paper, for $$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq 3$$$. </li><li> The demon can only see the colour of the cell in your paper if the corresponding cell in the secret paper has a hole in it. </li><li> The value on cell $$$(r, c)$$$ of the result grid is $$$1$$$ if there is an odd number of black cells that it can see through the holes, or $$$0$$$ otherwise. </li></ul><p>You win the round if the result grid consists of only the values $$$1$$$. Otherwise, the demon will give you the result grid as a feedback, and the round continues.</p><p>If you have spent all the coins and still did not win all the rounds, then you will be trapped forever. Escape the cursed game!</p>",

The grey-colored square represents the secret paper, and the circles represent the holes. In the first query, there are $$$4$$$ black cells that can be seen through the holes, therefore the value in cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ of the result grid is $$$0$$$. In the second query, there are $$$5$$$ black cells that can be seen through the holes, therefore the value in cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ of the result grid is $$$1$$$.
