    "statement": "<p>Certainly, everyone is familiar with tic-tac-toe game. The rules are very simple indeed. Two players take turns marking the cells in a <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20093</span> grid (one player always draws crosses, the other \u2014 noughts). The player who succeeds first in placing three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins, and the game is finished. The player who draws crosses goes first. If the grid is filled, but neither Xs, nor 0s form the required line, a draw is announced.</p><p>You are given a <span class=\"tex-span\">3\u2009\u00d7\u20093</span> grid, each grid cell is empty, or occupied by a cross or a nought.
