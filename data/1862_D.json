    "statement": "<p>Tema decided to improve his ice cream making skills. He has already learned how to make ice cream in a cone <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">using exactly two</span> balls.</p><p>Before his ice cream obsession, Tema was interested in mathematics. Therefore, he is curious about the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of balls he needs to have in order to make <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> types of ice cream.</p><p>There are plenty possible ice cream flavours: $$$1, 2, 3, \\dots$$$. Tema can make two-balls ice cream with any flavours (probably the same).</p><p>Two ice creams are considered different if their sets of ball flavours are different. For example, $$$\\{1, 2\\} = \\{2, 1\\}$$$, but $$$\\{1, 1\\} \\neq \\{1, 2\\}$$$.</p><p>For example, having the following ice cream balls: $$$\\{1, 1, 2\\}$$$, Tema can make only two types of ice cream: $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$ and $$$\\{1, 2\\}$$$.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note, that Tema do not need to make all the ice cream cones at the same time. This means that he making ice cream cones independently. Also in order to make a following cone $$$\\{x, x\\}$$$ for some $$$x$$$, Tema needs at least $$$2$$$ balls of type $$$x$$$</span>.</p><p>Help Tema answer this question. It can be shown that answer always exist.</p>",
