More formally, you choose some $$$i$$$ and replace $$$s_i$$$ (the character at the position $$$i$$$) with some character from '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>' to '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>'.</p><p>You want to do <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">no more than</span> $$$k$$$ replacements in such a way that <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximizes</span> the number of occurrences of $$$t$$$ in $$$s$$$ as a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">subsequence</span>.</p><p>Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</p>",
