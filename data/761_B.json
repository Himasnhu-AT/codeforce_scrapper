Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above. All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track. </p><p>Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap. Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track. Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> barriers. Thus, each of them wrote <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> integers in the ascending order, each of them was between <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i>\u2009-\u20091</span>, inclusively.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/05fc2956f9ec70231490593aa07711c666ebb3c8.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">Consider an example. Let <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i>\u2009=\u20098</span>, blue points are barriers, and green points are Kefa's start (A) and Sasha's start (B). Then Kefa writes down the sequence <span class=\"tex-span\">[2,\u20094,\u20096]</span>, and Sasha writes down <span class=\"tex-span\">[1,\u20095,\u20097]</span>.</span> </center><p>There are several tracks in the country, all of them have same length and same number of barriers, but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks. Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks. </p><p>Write the program which will check that Kefa's and Sasha's tracks coincide (it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position). Note that they always run the track in one direction \u2014 counterclockwise, if you look on a track from above. </p>",
