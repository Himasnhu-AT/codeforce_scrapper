    "statement": "<p>Madoka as a child was an extremely capricious girl, and one of her favorite pranks was drawing on her wall. According to Madoka's memories, the wall was a table of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, consisting only of zeroes and ones. The coordinate of the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column ($$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le j \\le m$$$) is $$$(i, j)$$$.</p><p>One day she saw a picture \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica\" and decided to draw it on her wall. Initially, the Madoka's table is a table of size $$$n \\times m$$$ filled with zeroes. Then she applies the following operation any number of times:</p><p>Madoka selects any rectangular subtable of the table and paints it in a chess coloring (the upper left corner of the subtable always has the color $$$0$$$). Note that some cells may be colored several times. In this case, the final color of the cell is equal to the color obtained during the last repainting.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"180px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/608d546eb53e7c4ace3c02f1c73546c46b6ba941.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"643px\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">White color means $$$0$$$, black means $$$1$$$. So, for example, the table in the first picture is painted in a chess coloring, and the others are not.</span> </center><p>For better understanding of the statement, we recommend you to read the explanation of the first test.</p><p>Help Madoka and find some sequence of no more than $$$n \\cdot m$$$ operations that allows you to obtain the picture she wants, or determine that this is impossible.</p>",
