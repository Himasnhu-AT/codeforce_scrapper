    "statement": "<p>Bob watches TV every day. He always sets the volume of his TV to $$$b$$$. However, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to $$$a$$$. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume.</p><p>There are six buttons ($$$-5, -2, -1, +1, +2, +5$$$) on the control, which in one press can either increase or decrease the current volume by $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, or $$$5$$$. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In other words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than $$$0$$$.</p><p>As Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to $$$b$$$ using as few button presses as possible. However, he forgets how to do such simple calculations, so he asks you for help. Write a program that given $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, finds the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \\le T \\le 1\\,000$$$). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \\le a, b \\le 10^{9}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the current volume and Bob's desired volume, respectively.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$. If Bob does not need to change the volume (i.e. $$$a=b$$$), then print $$$0$$$.</p>",

    "note": "<p>In the first example, Bob can press the $$$-2$$$ button twice to reach $$$0$$$. Note that Bob can not press $$$-5$$$ when the volume is $$$4$$$ since it will make the volume negative. </p><p>In the second example, one of the optimal ways for Bob is to press the $$$+5$$$ twice, then press $$$-1$$$ once.</p><p>In the last example, Bob can press the $$$+5$$$ once, then press $$$+1$$$. </p>",
