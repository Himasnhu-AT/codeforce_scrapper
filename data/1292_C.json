Markland-N, the young man Simon \"Xenon\" Jackson, takes a break after finishing his project early (as always). Having a lot of free time, he decides to put on his legendary hacker \"X\" instinct and fight against the gangs of the cyber world.</p><p>His target is a network of $$$n$$$ small gangs. This network contains exactly $$$n - 1$$$ direct links, each of them connecting two gangs together. The links are placed in such a way that every pair of gangs is connected through a sequence of direct links.</p><p>By mining data, Xenon figured out that the gangs used a form of cross-encryption to avoid being busted: every link was assigned an integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 2$$$ such that all assigned integers are distinct and every integer was assigned to some link. If an intruder tries to access the encrypted data, they will have to surpass $$$S$$$ password layers, with $$$S$$$ being defined by the following formula:</p><p>$$$$$$S = \\sum_{1 \\leq u &lt; v \\leq n} mex(u, v)$$$$$$</p><p>Here, $$$mex(u, v)$$$ denotes the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear on any link on the unique simple path from gang $$$u$$$ to gang $$$v$$$.</p><p>Xenon doesn't know the way the integers are assigned, but it's not a problem. He decides to let his AI's instances try all the passwords on his behalf, but before that, he needs to know the maximum possible value of $$$S$$$, so that the AIs can be deployed efficiently.</p><p>Now, Xenon is out to write the AI scripts, and he is expected to finish them in two hours. Can you find the maximum possible $$$S$$$ before he returns?</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 3000$$$), the number of gangs in the network.</p><p>Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u_i, v_i \\leq n$$$; $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$), indicating there's a direct link between gangs $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.</p><p>It's guaranteed that links are placed in such a way that each pair of gangs will be connected by exactly one simple path.</p>",
