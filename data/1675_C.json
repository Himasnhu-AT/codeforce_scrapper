    "statement": "<p>Polycarp bought a new expensive painting and decided to show it to his $$$n$$$ friends. He hung it in his room. $$$n$$$ of his friends entered and exited there one by one. At one moment there was no more than one person in the room. In other words, the first friend entered and left first, then the second, and so on.</p><p>It is known that at the beginning (before visiting friends) a picture hung in the room. At the end (after the $$$n$$$-th friend) it turned out that it disappeared. At what exact moment it disappeared\u00a0\u2014 there is no information.</p><p>Polycarp asked his friends one by one. He asked each one if there was a picture when he entered the room. Each friend answered one of three:</p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">no</span> (response encoded with <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>); </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">yes</span> (response encoded as <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>); </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">can't remember</span> (response is encoded with <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>). </li></ul><p>Everyone except the thief either doesn't remember or told the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">truth</span>. The thief can say anything (any of the three options).</p><p>Polycarp cannot understand who the thief is. He asks you to find out the number of those who can be considered a thief according to the answers.</p>",

Each character in the string is either <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span> or <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">?</span>.</p><p>The given regularity is described in the actual situation.
