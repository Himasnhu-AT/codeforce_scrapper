    "statement": "<p>Allen and Bessie are playing a simple number game. They both know a function $$$f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$$$, i.\u00a0e. the function takes $$$n$$$ binary arguments and returns a real value. At the start of the game, the variables $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ are all set to $$$-1$$$. Each round, with equal probability, one of Allen or Bessie gets to make a move. A move consists of picking an $$$i$$$ such that $$$x_i = -1$$$ and either setting $$$x_i \\to 0$$$ or $$$x_i \\to 1$$$.</p><p>After $$$n$$$ rounds all variables are set, and the game value resolves to $$$f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$$$. Allen wants to maximize the game value, and Bessie wants to minimize it.</p><p>Your goal is to help Allen and Bessie find the expected game value! They will play $$$r+1$$$ times though, so between each game, exactly one value of $$$f$$$ changes. In other words, between rounds $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for $$$1 \\le i \\le r$$$, $$$f(z_1, \\dots, z_n) \\to g_i$$$ for some $$$(z_1, \\dots, z_n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$$$. You are to find the expected game value in the beginning and after each change.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$, $$$0 \\le r \\le 2^{18}$$$).</p><p>The next line contains $$$2^n$$$ integers $$$c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{2^n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$$$), denoting the initial values of $$$f$$$. More specifically, $$$f(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}) = c_x$$$, if $$$x = \\overline{x_{n-1} \\ldots x_0}$$$ in binary.</p><p>Each of the next $$$r$$$ lines contains two integers $$$z$$$ and $$$g$$$ ($$$0 \\le z \\le 2^n - 1$$$, $$$0 \\le g \\le 10^9$$$). If $$$z = \\overline{z_{n-1} \\dots z_0}$$$ in binary, then this means to set $$$f(z_0, \\dots, z_{n-1}) \\to g$$$.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>Print $$$r+1$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which denotes the value of the game $$$f$$$ during the $$$i$$$-th round. Your answer must have absolute or relative error within $$$10^{-6}$$$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$.
