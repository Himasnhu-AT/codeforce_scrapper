    "note": "<p>In the first test case, we initially have a piece of size $$$1$$$, so all final pieces must have size $$$1$$$. The total number of steps is: $$$0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, we have just one piece, so we don't need to do anything, and the answer is $$$0$$$ steps.</p><p>In the third test case, one of the possible cut options is: $$$600,\\ 900,\\ (600 | 700),\\ (1000 | 1000),\\ (1000 | 1000 | 550)$$$. You can see this option in the picture below. The maximum piece has size $$$1000$$$, and it is less than $$$2$$$ times bigger than the minimum piece of size $$$550$$$. $$$4$$$ steps are done. We can show that it is the minimum possible number of steps.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/b87d9b307488ae31fa7868aa0def96c8764245cf.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"680px\"/> </center>",
