    "statement": "<p>Andrey received a postcard from Irina. It contained only the words \"Hello, Andrey!\", and a strange string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, snowflakes and candy canes. Andrey thought that this string is an encrypted message, and decided to decrypt it.</p><p>Andrey noticed that snowflakes and candy canes always stand after the letters, so he supposed that the message was encrypted as follows. Candy cane means that the letter before it can be removed, or can be left. A snowflake means that the letter before it can be removed, left, or repeated several times.</p><p>For example, consider the following string: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/2d9a7e9c013dce103f4972be609779c93fd7cc14.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>This string can encode the message \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">happynewyear</span>\u00bb. For this, candy canes and snowflakes should be used as follows: </p><ul> <li> candy cane 1: remove the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">w</span>, </li><li> snowflake 1: repeat the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">p</span> twice, </li><li> candy cane 2: leave the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">n</span>, </li><li> snowflake 2: remove the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">w</span>, </li><li> snowflake 3: leave the letter <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">e</span>. </li></ul><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/8f88019391dc40b2722534e5ba3b7c728f714660.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>Please note that the same string can encode different messages. For example, the string above can encode \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">hayewyar</span>\u00bb, \u00ab<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">happpppynewwwwwyear</span>\u00bb, and other messages.</p><p>Andrey knows that messages from Irina usually have a length of $$$k$$$ letters. Help him to find out if a given string can encode a message of $$$k$$$ letters, and if so, give an example of such a message.</p>",

These characters can only appear immediately after the letter.
