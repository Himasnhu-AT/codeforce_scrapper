    "statement": "<p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the three versions is the constraints on $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>Maxim is a minibus driver on Venus.</p><p>To ride on Maxim's minibus, you need a ticket. Each ticket has a number consisting of $$$n$$$ digits. However, as we know, the residents of Venus use a numeral system with base $$$k$$$, rather than the decimal system. Therefore, the ticket number can be considered as a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$k-1$$$, inclusive.</p><p>The residents of Venus consider a ticket to be <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">lucky</span> if there is a digit on it that is equal to the sum of the remaining digits, modulo $$$k$$$. For example, if $$$k=10$$$, then the ticket $$$7135$$$ is lucky because $$$7 + 1 + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$$$. On the other hand, the ticket $$$7136$$$ is not lucky because no digit is equal to the sum of the others modulo $$$10$$$.</p><p>Once, while on a trip, Maxim wondered: how many lucky tickets exist? At the same time, Maxim understands that this number can be very large, so he is interested only in the answer modulo some prime number $$$m$$$.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/3b29db871d0078c80df5803fddf4414b7d2aa221.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center>",
