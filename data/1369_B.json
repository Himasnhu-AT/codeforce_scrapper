Now he'd like to make it clean accurately and in a stylish way...</span></p><p>The string $$$s$$$ he found is a binary string of length $$$n$$$ (i. e. string consists only of <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>-s and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>-s).</p><p>In one move he can choose two consecutive characters $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$, and if $$$s_i$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span> and $$$s_{i + 1}$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>, he can erase <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one of them</span> (he can choose which one to erase but he can't erase both characters simultaneously). The string shrinks after erasing.</p><p>Lee can make an arbitrary number of moves (possibly zero) and he'd like to make the string $$$s$$$ as <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">clean</span> as possible.
