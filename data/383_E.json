    "statement": "<p>Iahubina is tired of so many complicated languages, so she decided to invent a new, simple language. She already made a dictionary consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> 3-words. A 3-word is a sequence of exactly <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> lowercase letters of the first 24 letters of the English alphabet (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>). She decided that some of the letters are vowels, and all the others are consonants. The whole language is based on a simple rule: any word that contains at least one vowel is <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">correct</span>.</p><p>Iahubina forgot which letters are the vowels, and wants to find some possible correct sets of vowels. She asks Iahub questions. In each question, she will give Iahub a set of letters considered vowels (in this question). For each question she wants to know how many words of the dictionary are correct, considering the given set of vowels.</p><p>Iahubina wants to know the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>xor</i></span> of the squared answers to all the possible questions. There are <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\">24</sup></span> different questions, they are all subsets of the set of the first 24 letters of the English alphabet. Help Iahub find that number.</p>",
