He is given a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> with his directions for motion:</p><ul><li> An '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>' indicates he should move one unit left. </li><li> An '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>' indicates he should move one unit right. </li><li> A '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>' indicates he should move one unit up. </li><li> A '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>' indicates he should move one unit down.</li></ul><p>But now Memory wants to end at the origin. To do this, he has a special trident. This trident can replace any character in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> with any of '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">L</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">R</span>', '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">U</span>', or '<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>'. However, because he doesn't want to wear out the trident, he wants to make the minimum number of edits possible. Please tell Memory what is the minimum number of changes he needs to make to produce a string that, when walked, will end at the origin, or if there is no such string.</p>",

One possible solution is to change <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> to \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">LDUR</span>\". This string uses 1 edit, which is the minimum possible. It also ends at the origin.</p>",
