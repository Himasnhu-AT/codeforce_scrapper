    "statement": "<p>A top-secret military base under the command of Colonel Zuev is expecting an inspection from the Ministry of Defence. According to the charter, each top-secret military base must include a top-secret troop that should... well, we cannot tell you exactly what it should do, it is a top secret troop at the end. The problem is that Zuev's base is missing this top-secret troop for some reasons.</p><p>The colonel decided to deal with the problem immediately and ordered to line up in a single line all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> soldiers of the base entrusted to him. Zuev knows that the <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">loquacity</span> of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th soldier from the left is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>q</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. Zuev wants to form the top-secret troop using <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> leftmost soldiers in the line, thus he wants their total loquacity to be as small as possible (as the troop should remain top-secret). To achieve this, he is going to choose a pair of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consecutive</span> soldiers and swap them. He intends to do so no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> times. Note that any soldier can be a participant of such swaps for any number of times. The problem turned out to be unusual, and colonel Zuev asked you to help.</p><p>Determine, what is the minimum total loquacity of the first <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> soldiers in the line, that can be achieved by performing no more than <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> swaps of two consecutive soldiers.</p>",
