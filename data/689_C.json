    "statement": "<p>Bad news came to Mike's village, some thieves stole a bunch of chocolates from the local factory! Horrible! </p><p>Aside from loving sweet things, thieves from this area are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of chocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> times more than the previous one. The value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i>\u2009&gt;\u20091</span>) is a secret integer known only to them. It is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> chocolates (if they intend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly four</span> thieves involved. </p><p>Sadly, only the thieves know the value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, but rumours say that the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>, but not fixed <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>) is <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves (they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different number of chocolates in them.</p><p>Mike want to track the thieves down, so he wants to know what their bags are and value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> will help him in that. Please find <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">the smallest possible</span> value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> or tell him that the rumors are false and there is no such <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>.</p>",
