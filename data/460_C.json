Soon his informatics teacher is going to have a birthday and the beaver has decided to prepare a present for her. He planted <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> flowers in a row on his windowsill and started waiting for them to grow. However, after some time the beaver noticed that the flowers stopped growing. The beaver thinks it is bad manners to present little flowers. So he decided to come up with some solutions. </p><p>There are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> days left to the birthday. The height of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th flower (assume that the flowers in the row are numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> from left to right) is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> at the moment. At each of the remaining <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> days the beaver can take a special watering and water <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i></span> contiguous flowers (he can do that only once at a day). At that each watered flower grows by one height unit on that day. The beaver wants the height of the smallest flower be as large as possible in the end.
