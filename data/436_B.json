    "statement": "<p>Om Nom really likes candies and doesn't like spiders as they frequently steal candies. One day Om Nom fancied a walk in a park. Unfortunately, the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesn't want to see them at all.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/aefe229245c1cb10eb6f2265295bd3514d4df93a.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>The park can be represented as a rectangular <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009\u00d7\u2009<i>m</i></span> field. The park has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> spiders, each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field. The spiders move all the time, and each spider always moves in one of the four directions (left, right, down, up). In a unit of time, a spider crawls from his cell to the side-adjacent cell in the corresponding direction. If there is no cell in the given direction, then the spider leaves the park. The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move. Specifically, one cell can have multiple spiders at the same time.</p><p>Om Nom isn't yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants:</p><ul> <li> to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field (it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders); </li><li> to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row (the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park). </li></ul><p>We know that Om Nom moves by jumping. One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a side-adjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundaries.</p><p>Each time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time. Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from. That's why he wonders: for each possible starting cell, how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell? Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell.</p>",
