Therefore, he wanted to give her a drawing and attract her attention.</p><p>As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$, in which some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at least</span> $$$k$$$ diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$ has a total of $$$4n - 2$$$ diagonals.</p><p>Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the minimum number of cells he needs to color.</p>",
