The characters in the strings are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p><p>You can successively perform the following move any number of times (possibly, zero):</p><ul> <li> swap any two adjacent (neighboring) characters of $$$s$$$ (i.e. for any $$$i = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n - 1\\}$$$ you can swap $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i + 1})$$$. </li></ul><p>You can't apply a move to the string $$$t$$$. The moves are applied to the string $$$s$$$ one after another.</p><p>Your task is to obtain the string $$$t$$$ from the string $$$s$$$. Find any way to do it with at most $$$10^4$$$ such moves.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">You do not have to minimize the number of moves, just find any sequence of moves of length $$$10^4$$$ or less to transform $$$s$$$ into $$$t$$$.</span></p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>If it is impossible to obtain the string $$$t$$$ using moves, print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>\".</p><p>Otherwise in the first line print one integer $$$k$$$ \u2014 the number of moves to transform $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$. Note that $$$k$$$ must be an integer number between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^4$$$ inclusive.</p><p>In the second line print $$$k$$$ integers $$$c_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le c_j &lt; n$$$), where $$$c_j$$$ means that on the $$$j$$$-th move you swap characters $$$s_{c_j}$$$ and $$$s_{c_j + 1}$$$.</p><p>If you do not need to apply any moves, print a single integer $$$0$$$ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.</p>",
