    "statement": "<p>Recently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of $$$n$$$ heroes, the strength of the $$$i$$$-th hero is equal to $$$a_i$$$.</p><p>According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to $$$x$$$, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least $$$x$$$ to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is $$$y$$$, then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least $$$y$$$.</p><p>The player can increase the strength of any hero by $$$1$$$ for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.</p><p>There are $$$m$$$ dragons in the game, the $$$i$$$-th of them has defense equal to $$$x_i$$$ and attack power equal to $$$y_i$$$. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the $$$i$$$-th dragon.</p><p>Note that the task is solved <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">independently for each dragon</span> (improvements are not saved).</p>",
