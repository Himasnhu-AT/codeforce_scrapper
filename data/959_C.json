    "statement": "<p>Mahmoud was trying to solve the vertex cover problem on trees. The problem statement is:</p><p>Given an undirected tree consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> nodes, find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges. Formally, we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge <span class=\"tex-span\">(<i>u</i>,\u2009<i>v</i>)</span> that belongs to the tree, either <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i></span> is in the set, or <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> is in the set, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">or both are in the set</span>. Mahmoud has found the following algorithm:</p><ul> <li> Root the tree at node <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. </li><li> Count the number of nodes at an even depth. Let it be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>evenCnt</i></span>. </li><li> Count the number of nodes at an odd depth. Let it be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>oddCnt</i></span>. </li><li> The answer is the minimum between <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>evenCnt</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>oddCnt</i></span>. </li></ul><p>The depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root. The depth of the root is 0.</p><p>Ehab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong, but he didn't believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked, so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> nodes. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the first tree and a correct answer for the second one.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The only line contains an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(2\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup>)</span>, the number of nodes in the desired trees.</p>",
    "outputSpecification": "<p>The output should consist of 2 <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">independent</span> sections, each containing a tree. The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the tree in the first section and a correct answer for the tree in the second. If a tree doesn't exist for some section, output \"-1\" (without quotes) <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">for that section only</span>.</p><p>If the answer for a section exists, it should contain <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i>\u2009-\u20091</span> lines, each containing 2 space-separated integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(1\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>u</i>,\u2009<i>v</i>\u2009\u2264\u2009<i>n</i>)</span>, which means that there's an undirected edge between node <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>u</i></span> and node <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>v</i></span>. If the given graph isn't a tree or it doesn't follow the format, you'll receive wrong answer verdict.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</p>",
