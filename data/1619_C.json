    "statement": "<p>Tanya is learning how to add numbers, but so far she is not doing it correctly. She is adding two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ using the following algorithm:</p><ol> <li> If one of the numbers is shorter than the other, Tanya adds leading zeros so that the numbers are the same length. </li><li> The numbers are processed from right to left (that is, from the least significant digits to the most significant). </li><li> In the first step, she adds the last digit of $$$a$$$ to the last digit of $$$b$$$ and writes their sum in the answer. </li><li> At each next step, she performs the same operation on each pair of digits in the same place and writes the result to the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">left</span> side of the answer. </li></ol> <p>For example, the numbers $$$a = 17236$$$ and $$$b = 3465$$$ Tanya adds up as follows:</p><p>$$$$$$ \\large{ \\begin{array}{r} + \\begin{array}{r} 17236\\\\ 03465\\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ \\hline \\begin{array}{r} 1106911 \\end{array} \\end{array}} $$$$$$</p><ul> <li> calculates the sum of $$$6 + 5 = 11$$$ and writes $$$11$$$ in the answer. </li><li> calculates the sum of $$$3 + 6 = 9$$$ and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get $$$911$$$. </li><li> calculates the sum of $$$2 + 4 = 6$$$ and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get $$$6911$$$. </li><li> calculates the sum of $$$7 + 3 = 10$$$, and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get $$$106911$$$. </li><li> calculates the sum of $$$1 + 0 = 1$$$ and writes the result to the left side of the answer and get $$$1106911$$$. </li></ul><p>As a result, she gets $$$1106911$$$.</p><p>You are given two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$s$$$. Find the number $$$b$$$ such that by adding $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as described above, Tanya will get $$$s$$$. Or determine that no suitable $$$b$$$ exists.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>For each test case print the answer on a separate line.</p><p>If the solution exists, print a single positive integer $$$b$$$.
