    "statement": "<p>The Little Girl loves problems on games very much. Here's one of them.</p><p>Two players have got a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:</p><ul> <li> The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. </li><li> If the player before his turn can reorder the letters in string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> so as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abba</span>\" is a palindrome and string \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>\" isn't. </li></ul><p>Determine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well \u2014 the one who moves first or the one who moves second.</p>",

    "outputSpecification": "<p>In a single line print word \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">First</span>\" if the first player wins (provided that both players play optimally well).
