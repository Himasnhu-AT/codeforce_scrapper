Each of you <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">independently</span> labeled the vertices from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Neither of you know the other's labelling of the tree.</p><p>You and Li Chen each chose a subtree (i.e., a connected subgraph) in that tree. Your subtree consists of the vertices labeled $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k_1}$$$ in <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">your labeling</span>, Li Chen's subtree consists of the vertices labeled $$$y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{k_2}$$$ in <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">his labeling</span>. The values of $$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k_1}$$$ and $$$y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{k_2}$$$ are known to both of you.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"106px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/0d92bdd16622d33d9c23727641585ad707fb7f65.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"491px\"/> </center><center> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The picture shows two labelings of a possible tree: yours on the left and Li Chen's on the right. The selected trees are highlighted. There are two common nodes.</span> </center><p>You want to determine whether your subtrees have at least one common vertex. Luckily, your friend Andrew knows both labelings of the tree. You can ask Andrew at most $$$5$$$ questions, each of which is in one of the following two forms: </p><ul> <li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A x</span>: Andrew will look at vertex $$$x$$$ in your labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in Li Chen's labeling. </li><li> <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B y</span>: Andrew will look at vertex $$$y$$$ in Li Chen's labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in your labeling. </li></ul><p>Determine whether the two subtrees have at least one common vertex after asking some questions. If there is at least one common vertex, determine one of your labels for any of the common vertices.</p>",

Andrew responds with $$$2$$$. At this point, you know that both of your subtrees contain the same node (i.e. node $$$1$$$ according to your labeling), so you can output \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C 1</span>\" and finish. However, you can also ask Andrew to look at node $$$2$$$ in Li Chen's labelling and tell you the label of it in your labelling. Andrew responds with $$$1$$$ (this step was given with the only reason\u00a0\u2014 to show you how to ask questions).</p><p>For the second sample, there are two test cases. The first looks is the one from the statement: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"106px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/5eb8db814ddeb807b5c54534394b6bc3e7feb605.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"491px\"/> </center><p>We first ask \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B 2</span>\", and Andrew will tell us $$$3$$$. In this case, we know $$$3$$$ is a common vertex, and moreover, any subtree with size $$$3$$$ that contains node $$$3$$$ must contain node $$$1$$$ as well, so we can output either \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C 1</span>\" or \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C 3</span>\" as our answer.</p><p>In the second case in the second sample, the situation looks as follows: </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"106px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/47372f99217b6cb79199bd85f95c822fd0e16ffd.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"491px\"/> </center><p>In this case, you know that the only subtree of size $$$3$$$ that doesn't contain node $$$1$$$ is subtree $$$4,5,6$$$. You ask Andrew for the label of node $$$1$$$ in Li Chen's labelling and Andrew says $$$5$$$. In this case, you know that Li Chen's subtree doesn't contain node $$$1$$$, so his subtree must be consist of the nodes $$$4,5,6$$$ (in your labelling), thus the two subtrees have no common nodes.</p>",
