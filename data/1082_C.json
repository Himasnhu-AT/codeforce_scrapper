For the $$$i$$$-th person he knows subject $$$s_i$$$ the candidate specializes in and $$$r_i$$$ \u2014 a skill level in his specialization (this level can be negative!). </p><p>The rules of the competition require each delegation to choose some subset of subjects they will participate in. The only restriction is that the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">number of students from the team</span> participating in each of the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">chosen</span> subjects should be the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">same</span>.</p><p>Alex decided that each candidate would participate only in the subject he specializes in. Now Alex wonders whom he has to choose to maximize the total sum of skill levels of all delegates, or just skip the competition this year if every valid non-empty delegation has negative sum.</p><p>(Of course, Alex doesn't have any spare money so each delegate he chooses must participate in the competition).</p>",
