    "statement": "<p>You are given a room that can be represented by a $$$n \\times m$$$ grid. There is a ball at position $$$(i_1, j_1)$$$ (the intersection of row $$$i_1$$$ and column $$$j_1$$$), and it starts going diagonally in one of the four directions:</p><ul> <li> The ball is going down and right, denoted by $$$\\texttt{DR}$$$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i+1, j+1)$$$. </li><li> The ball is going down and left, denoted by $$$\\texttt{DL}$$$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i+1, j-1)$$$. </li><li> The ball is going up and right, denoted by $$$\\texttt{UR}$$$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i-1, j+1)$$$. </li><li> The ball is going up and left, denoted by $$$\\texttt{UL}$$$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $$$(i, j)$$$ to $$$(i-1, j-1)$$$. </li></ul><p>After each step, the ball maintains its direction unless it hits a wall (that is, the direction takes it out of the room's bounds in the next step). In this case, the ball's direction gets flipped along the axis of the wall; if the ball hits a corner, both directions get flipped. Any instance of this is called a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">bounce</span>. The ball never stops moving.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/68fb933992966f153dedcd27d5bf0f7876425541.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> </center><p>In the above example, the ball starts at $$$(1, 7)$$$ and goes $$$\\texttt{DL}$$$ until it reaches the bottom wall, then it bounces and continues in the direction $$$\\texttt{UL}$$$. After reaching the left wall, the ball bounces and continues to go in the direction $$$\\texttt{UR}$$$. When the ball reaches the upper wall, it bounces and continues in the direction $$$\\texttt{DR}$$$. After reaching the bottom-right corner, it bounces <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">once</span> and continues in direction $$$\\texttt{UL}$$$, and so on.</p><p>Your task is to find how many bounces the ball will go through until it reaches cell $$$(i_2, j_2)$$$ in the room, or report that it never reaches cell $$$(i_2, j_2)$$$ by printing $$$-1$$$.</p><p>Note that the ball first goes in a cell and only after that bounces if it needs to.</p>",
    "inputSpecification": "<p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains six integers and a string $$$n, m, i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2, d$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n, m \\leq 25000$$$; $$$1 \\leq i_1, i_2 \\leq n$$$; $$$1 \\leq j_1, j_2 \\leq m$$$; $$$d \\in\\{ \\texttt{DR}, \\texttt{DL}, \\texttt{UR}, \\texttt{UL}\\}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the grid, the starting coordinates of the ball, the coordinates of the final cell and the starting direction of the ball.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \\cdot 10^4$$$.</p>",
