Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a number written on it.</p><p>Initially, your score is $$$0$$$. The game is composed of $$$n$$$ rounds. For each $$$1\\le i\\le n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th round works as follows.</p><p>On the screen, a symbol $$$s_i$$$ appears, which is either $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ (<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">plus</span>) or $$$\\texttt{-}$$$ (<span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">minus</span>). Then you must press one of the two buttons on the controller <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">once</span>. Suppose you press a button with the number $$$x$$$ written on it: your score will increase by $$$x$$$ if the symbol was $$$\\texttt{+}$$$ and will decrease by $$$x$$$ if the symbol was $$$\\texttt{-}$$$. After you press the button, the round ends. </p><p>After you have played all $$$n$$$ rounds, you win if your score is $$$0$$$.</p><p>Over the years, your grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have $$$q$$$ of them. The two buttons on the $$$j$$$-th controller have the numbers $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether you can win the game playing with that controller.</p>",
