Note that an empty subsequence is also increasing.</p><p>You are given a positive integer $$$X$$$. Your task is to find an array of integers of length <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most $$$200$$$</span>, such that it has exactly $$$X$$$ increasing subsequences, or report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can print any of them.</p><p>If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array $$$[2, 2]$$$ has two different subsequences equal to $$$[2]$$$).</p>",

Otherwise, print a positive integer $$$n$$$ on the first line\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array. On the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers\u00a0\u2014 the required array itself. If there are several answers, you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range $$$[-10^9; 10^9]$$$.</p>",
