    "statement": "<p>Hideo Kojima has just quit his job at Konami. Now he is going to find a new place to work. Despite being such a well-known person, he still needs a CV to apply for a job.</p><p>During all his career Hideo has produced <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> games. Some of them were successful, some were not. Hideo wants to remove several of them (possibly zero) from his CV to make a better impression on employers. As a result there should be no unsuccessful game which comes right after successful one in his CV.</p><p>More formally, you are given an array <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">1</sub>,\u2009<i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\">2</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009<i>s</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>n</i></sub></span> of zeros and ones. Zero corresponds to an unsuccessful game, one \u2014 to a successful one. Games are given in order they were produced, and Hideo can't swap these values. He should remove some elements from this array in such a way that no zero comes right after one.</p><p>Besides that, Hideo still wants to mention as much games in his CV as possible. Help this genius of a man determine the maximum number of games he can leave in his CV.</p>",
