For example, if $$$s = \\mathtt{abaab}$$$ with the cursor on the second character ($$$\\mathtt{a[b]aab}$$$), then:</p><ul><li> moving to the closest letter $$$\\mathtt{a}$$$ to the left places the cursor on the first character ($$$\\mathtt{[a]baab}$$$);</li><li> moving to the closest letter $$$\\mathtt{a}$$$ to the right places the cursor the third character ($$$\\mathtt{ab[a]ab}$$$);</li><li> moving to the closest letter $$$\\mathtt{b}$$$ to the right places the cursor on the fifth character ($$$\\mathtt{abaa[b]}$$$);</li><li> any other operation leaves the cursor in place.</li></ul><p>Let $$$\\mathrm{dist}(i, j)$$$ be the smallest number of operations needed to move the cursor from the $$$i$$$-th character to the $$$j$$$-th character.
