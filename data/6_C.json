For each chocololate bar the time, needed for the player to consume it, is known (Alice and Bob eat them with equal speed). When the player consumes a chocolate bar, he immediately starts with another. It is not allowed to eat two chocolate bars at the same time, to leave the bar unfinished and to make pauses.
