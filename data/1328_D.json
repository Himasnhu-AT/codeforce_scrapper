You think that it's boring if the carousel contains two different figures (with the distinct types of animals) going one right after another and colored in the same color.</p><p>Your task is to color the figures in such a way that the number of distinct colors used is the minimum possible and there are no figures of the different types going one right after another and colored in the same color. If you use exactly $$$k$$$ distinct colors, then the colors of figures should be denoted with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.</p>",
