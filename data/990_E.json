    "statement": "<p>Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX axis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has $$$n$$$ positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.</p><p>There are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position $$$x$$$, post lamp of power $$$l$$$ illuminates the segment $$$[x; x + l]$$$. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.</p><p>The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power $$$1$$$ to power $$$k$$$. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">exactly one</span> type. Post lamps of power $$$l$$$ cost $$$a_l$$$ each.</p><p>What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">exactly one</span> type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $$$[0; n]$$$ of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power $$$3$$$ in position $$$n - 1$$$ (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment $$$[0; n]$$$).</p>",
