He defines the cost of $$$s$$$ as the minimum between: </p><ul> <li> The maximum among all elements at odd indices of $$$s$$$. </li><li> The maximum among all elements at even indices of $$$s$$$. </li></ul><p>Note that the index of an element is its index in $$$s$$$, rather than its index in $$$a$$$.
