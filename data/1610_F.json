But he made several rules for himself. And also he was too busy with his plans that he didn't have time for such minor tasks, so he asked you for help.</span></p><p>Mashtali's graph is an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">undirected</span> weighted graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges with weights equal to either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$. Lee wants to direct the edges of Mashtali's graph so that it will be as beautiful as possible.</p><p>Lee thinks that the beauty of a directed weighted graph is equal to the number of its Oddysey vertices. A vertex $$$v$$$ is an Oddysey vertex if $$$|d^+(v) - d^-(v)| = 1$$$, where $$$d^+(v)$$$ is the sum of weights of the outgoing from $$$v$$$ edges, and $$$d^-(v)$$$ is the sum of the weights of the incoming to $$$v$$$ edges.</p><p>Find the largest possible beauty of a graph that Lee can achieve by directing the edges of Mashtali's graph. In addition, find any way to achieve it.</p><p>Note that you have to orient each edge.</p>",
