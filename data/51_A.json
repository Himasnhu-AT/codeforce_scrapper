    "statement": "<p>Cheaterius is a famous in all the Berland astrologist, magician and wizard, and he also is a liar and a cheater. One of his latest inventions is Cheaterius' amulets! They bring luck and wealth, but are rather expensive. Cheaterius makes them himself. The technology of their making is kept secret. But we know that throughout long nights Cheaterius glues together domino pairs with super glue to get squares <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u00d7\u20092</span> which are the Cheaterius' magic amulets! </p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/20b9439df25e2204fb327b27bbd24d047e430ac1.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">That's what one of Cheaterius's amulets looks like</span> </center><p>After a hard night Cheaterius made <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> amulets. Everyone of them represents a square <span class=\"tex-span\">2\u2009\u00d7\u20092</span>, every quarter contains 1 to 6 dots. Now he wants sort them into piles, every pile must contain similar amulets. Two amulets are called similar if they can be rotated by 90, 180 or 270 degrees so that the following condition is met: the numbers of dots in the corresponding quarters should be the same. It is forbidden to turn over the amulets.</p><p>Write a program that by the given amulets will find the number of piles on Cheaterius' desk.</p>",
