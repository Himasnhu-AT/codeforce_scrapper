It doesn't matter if Bob paints the first and the second cells or the fifth and sixth cells, as Alice can paint the other two cells.</p><p>In the fourth testcase at first, Alice paints the second and the third cells. If Bob paints the fifth and the sixth cells or the fourth and the fifth cells, then Alice paints the seventh and the eighth cells. If Bob paints the seventh and the eighth cells, then Alice paints the fifth and the sixth cells.</p><p>In the fifth Alice chooses the middle two cells at first, then Bob obviously has only two options, whichever variant he chooses, Alice can choose the other one and win.</p><p>In the eighth no matter what Alice chooses, Bob can choose the other two symmetrical cells.</p>",
