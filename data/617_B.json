Bob wants to break the bar of chocolate into multiple pieces so that each part would contain <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> one nut and any break line goes between two adjacent pieces.</p><p>You are asked to calculate the number of ways he can do it. Two ways to break chocolate are considered distinct if one of them contains a break between some two adjacent pieces and the other one doesn't. </p><p>Please note, that if Bob doesn't make any breaks, all the bar will form one piece and it still has to have exactly one nut.</p>",
