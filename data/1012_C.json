    "statement": "<p>Welcome to Innopolis city. Throughout the whole year, Innopolis citizens suffer from everlasting city construction. </p><p>From the window in your room, you see the sequence of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> hills, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th of them has height <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span>. The Innopolis administration wants to build some houses on the hills. However, for the sake of city appearance, a house can be only built on the hill, which is strictly higher than neighbouring hills (if they are present). For example, if the sequence of heights is <span class=\"tex-span\">5,\u20094,\u20096,\u20092</span>, then houses could be built on hills with heights <span class=\"tex-span\">5</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> only.</p><p>The Innopolis administration has an excavator, that can decrease the height of an arbitrary hill by one in one hour. The excavator can only work on one hill at a time. It is allowed to decrease hills up to zero height, or even to negative values. Increasing height of any hill is impossible. The city administration wants to build <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> houses, so there must be at least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> hills that satisfy the condition above. What is the minimum time required to adjust the hills to achieve the administration's plan?</p><p>However, the exact value of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> is not yet determined, so could you please calculate answers for all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span> in range <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c239e3441aedbd42f6603a403dbf2ff06fcdc2df.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"/>?
