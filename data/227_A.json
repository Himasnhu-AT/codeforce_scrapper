    "statement": "<p>Trouble came from the overseas lands: a three-headed dragon Gorynych arrived. The dragon settled at point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>C</i></span> and began to terrorize the residents of the surrounding villages.</p><p>A brave hero decided to put an end to the dragon. He moved from point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> to fight with Gorynych. The hero rode from point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span> along a straight road and met point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> on his way. The hero knows that in this land for every pair of roads it is true that they are either parallel to each other, or lie on a straight line, or are perpendicular to each other. He also knows well that points <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>C</i></span> are connected by a road. So the hero must either turn 90 degrees to the left or continue riding straight ahead or turn 90 degrees to the right. But he forgot where the point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>C</i></span> is located.</p><p>Fortunately, a Brave Falcon flew right by. It can see all three points from the sky. The hero asked him what way to go to get to the dragon's lair.</p><p>If you have not got it, you are the falcon. Help the hero and tell him how to get him to point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>C</i></span>: turn left, go straight or turn right.</p><p>At this moment the hero is believed to stand at point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>B</i></span>, turning his back to point <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>A</i></span>.</p>",
